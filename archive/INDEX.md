# Archive Index - HTML Converter Project

This directory contains archived files from the HTML Converter project, organized by date to maintain full project history while keeping the working directory clean.

## Archive Structure

```
archive/
├── INDEX.md                    # This file - archive catalog
└── 2025-01-30/                # Housekeeping date
    └── build-artifacts/        # Python build artifacts
        └── __pycache__/        # Compiled Python bytecode
            └── main.cpython-312.pyc
```

## Archive Log

### 2025-01-30 - Universal Housekeeping
**Operation**: Safe archival of build artifacts  
**Trigger**: Universal housekeeping command execution  
**Items Archived**:
- `__pycache__/` directory - Python bytecode cache (can be regenerated)
- `main.cpython-312.pyc` - Compiled bytecode for main.py

**Rationale**: 
- Build artifacts clutter working directory
- Files are regenerated automatically by Python
- Preserved for debugging purposes if needed
- Project functionality unchanged - bytecode cache not needed for distribution

**Recovery**: 
- Files will regenerate on next Python execution
- Archived version available at `archive/2025-01-30/build-artifacts/`
- No impact on project functionality

**Project Impact**: None - purely cosmetic cleanup

## Archive Retrieval

To restore archived files if needed:
```bash
# Restore specific file
cp archive/YYYY-MM-DD/path/to/file destination/

# Restore entire directory  
cp -r archive/YYYY-MM-DD/directory/ destination/
```

## Safety Features

- ✅ No files deleted - all archived with timestamps
- ✅ Full traceability of what was moved and when
- ✅ Clear recovery instructions documented
- ✅ Project integrity maintained
