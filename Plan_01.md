## Data Extraction Script Plan

### Overview
Create a Python script to extract specific line ranges from `Podcast1+2+3+4+5.md` (111,998 lines) based on the 63 line ranges specified in `Extraction.csv`, then combine all extracted sections into a new file `Extracted.md`.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. **Setup and Configuration**
- Create `scripts/extract_sections.py` in the project
- Import necessary libraries (csv, os, sys)
- Define file paths for input/output files
- Add logging for progress tracking

#### 2. **Parse CSV Instructions**
- Read `data/Extraction.csv` file
- Parse FROM and TO columns (63 ranges total)
- Validate line ranges (ensure FROM < TO)
- Handle empty rows gracefully
- Store ranges in a list of tuples

#### 3. **Read and Extract Content**
- Open `data/Podcast1+2+3+4+5.md` file
- Read all lines into memory (considering file size ~10MB)
- For each range (FROM, TO):
  - Extract lines from FROM to TO (inclusive)
  - Add section separator between extracts
  - Track extraction progress

#### 4. **Write Output File**
- Create `data/Extracted.md` file
- Write header with extraction metadata
- Write each extracted section with:
  - Section number
  - Original line range reference
  - The extracted content
  - Section separator

#### 5. **Validation and Verification**
- Count total lines extracted
- Verify all 63 ranges were processed
- Check for overlapping ranges
- Log statistics (lines extracted, sections created)
- Compare expected vs actual line counts

#### 6. **Error Handling**
- Handle file not found errors
- Validate line numbers don't exceed file length
- Handle encoding issues (UTF-8 with BOM)
- Provide clear error messages
- Create backup before processing

#### 7. **Final Checks**
- Generate extraction report showing:
  - Total sections extracted: 63
  - Total lines extracted
  - Any warnings or issues
  - File sizes before/after
- Verify output file is readable
- Optional: Create a summary file with statistics

### Script Structure
```
scripts/
└── extract_sections.py
    - Main function
    - CSV parser function
    - Content extractor function
    - Output writer function
    - Validation function
    - Error handling wrapper
```

### Expected Output
- `data/Extracted.md` containing all 63 extracted sections
- Console output showing progress
- Log file with detailed extraction information
- Summary report of the extraction process

This plan ensures accurate extraction while providing transparency and error recovery capabilities.
