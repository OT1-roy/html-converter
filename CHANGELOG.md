## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.x to 2.0

The 2.0 release introduces a dual-engine architecture. While backward compatible, you may want to take advantage of new features:

#### Default Engine Change
```bash
# Old behavior (Pandoc only)
python main.py input/ output/

# New behavior (html-to-text by default)
python main.py input/ output/

# To use old Pandoc engine explicitly
python main.py input/ output/ --engine pandoc
```

#### New Dependencies
```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies for html-to-text engine
npm install -g @html-to/text-cli
npm install -g html-to-md

# Or continue using Pandoc only
python main.py input/ output/ --engine pandoc
```

#### API Changes
```python
# Old API (1.x)
from main import convert_html_to_output
result = convert_html_to_output(html, 'md')  # Only Pandoc

# New API (2.0)
from main import convert_html_to_output
result = convert_html_to_output(html, 'md', 'html-to-text')  # Engine selection
result = convert_html_to_output(html, 'md', 'pandoc')       # Use Pandoc
```

### Migration Checklist

- [ ] Install Node.js 14+ (for html-to-text engine)
- [ ] Install npm packages: `@html-to/text-cli` and `html-to-md`
- [ ] Update any scripts to include `--engine` parameter if needed
- [ ] Test with both engines to determine best fit
- [ ] Update any API integrations for new function signature
- [ ] Review logs for engine selection confirmation

## Deprecation Notices

### Version 3.0 (Planned)

The following features will be deprecated in version 3.0:

1. **Python 3.7 support** - Minimum version will be Python 3.8
2. **Single-file processing** - Will require batch processing
3. **Implicit engine selection** - Engine parameter will be required

### Preparing for 3.0

```python
# Start using explicit engine selection
convert_html_to_output(html, format='md', engine='html-to-text')

# Prepare for batch processing
process_html_files(input_dir, output_dir, format, engine)

# Update to Python 3.8+
# Check with: python --version
```
