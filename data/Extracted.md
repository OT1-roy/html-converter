Before March of this year, Laurel Wamsley ’06 covered stories for NPR focusing on cities, technology, policy, and criminal justice. Now, the Washington, D.C.-based alumna covers the coronavirus which, of course, has impacted all aspects of society.

In between filing stories, Laurel spoke with Morehead-Cain from her home in the Columbia Heights neighborhood to share what the past two months have been like, how NPR has changed its approach to reaching Americans, and her thoughts on the impact the pandemic will have on public trust in local media and national news organizations.

Morehead-Cain has also been gathering stories from alumni on their efforts to help those most affected by COVID-19 outbreaks throughout the world, support health care workers, increase access to research, and so much more.

Here are just a few of them:

* Norton Tennille, Jr. ’62, founder of the nonprofit South African Education and Environmental Project (SAEP), is [raising funds to buy and deliver grocery packages and vouchers](https://www.saep.org/donate) for families in Cape Town, South Africa.
* Natalie Feingold ’15, a global account executive at Flexport, is helping coordinate logistics surrounding the supply of emergency equipment to healthcare workers worldwide through the [Frontline Responders Fund.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/frontlinerespondersfund)
* Josh Lee ’04, the founder of Green Top Farms, is helping manage [a program to feed food-insecure families](https://donate.greentop.farm/) by partnering with pantries and shelters in New York City.

The intro music for this episode is by scholar Scott Hallyburton ’22, guitarist of the band South of the Soul. The ending song, entitled “Morning Light,” is by Jakob Hamilton ’19, a keyboardist and composer.

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Sarah O’Carroll. I have with me Laurel Wamsley, Class of 2006 and a reporter for NPR. I spoke with Laurel to hear about what it’s been like to cover the coronavirus pandemic.*

(Sarah)

*Laurel, thanks for making some time to speak with me.*

(Laurel)

*Of course, I’m glad to do it.*

(Sarah)

*Are you still in the D.C. area or where are you reporting from?*

(Laurel)

*Yes, I’m talking to you from my home office here in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where I live.*

(Sarah)

*Well, I’m sure that the transition to remote work has been a lot to get used to — but then again, maybe not, because I know that as a journalist, you’ve likely reported from many nontraditional work environments. So, I first wanted to ask: how has the coronavirus changed your interview process?*

(Laurel)

*Yeah, it definitely has changed things. I’m mostly a digital reporter. I do radio stories, but the bulk of what I do are written stories, so I’ve always been doing a lot of phone interviews. So, in some ways, that hasn’t totally changed. What has changed is how I do them and the sort of tools I use. Normally, if I was working on a story and I was working from NPR headquarters, I would set up time to use one of our recording booths, and I’d go in there and record.*

*Since this started, obviously, I’ve been working from home. I haven’t been at the office since like March 11th or 12th. NPR has done a really good job of rolling out a lot of work from home tools. While some people, at other businesses, I’m sure have worked from home a lot before this, most of us at NPR never did. I literally never worked from home before this.*

*They rolled out a lot of tools to us, including the ability to use Conference Bridge phone line and record with that. That has turned out to be super convenient for me. It’s something. But it took this crisis to have the ability to use that. Now that I do, I’m not sure I’ll go back after this. I mean, I’ll go back to the office, but I will continue to use that tool. In some ways, like the reporting itself, for me, as someone who does a lot of reporting over the phone, that’s not totally different.*

*But I think what is hard is not being around my colleagues. I used to, for a few years, I was a freelance writer. It feels more like that because here I am, just plugging away for eight or nine hours a day. I really do miss my colleagues. NPR is a pretty close-knit work environment where your colleagues are also your friends, and in a lot of cases, that just helps break up the workday.*

*Also, for me, I’m basically a general assignment reporter, so I write and report on all different kinds of things from, national news to international news, to sports to what have you. For now, I have essentially become basically a coronavirus science reporter since this started. It’s been a little bit crazy to, in some ways, have almost an entirely new job, like a whole new beat, but to be doing that away from everyone else.*

*If this was happening but we were all still at the office, I could go and sit at a desk by other science desk reporters and ask them questions of how they handle certain situations. But now all of that is happening over Slack and email and morning conference calls with the other reporters on the science desk. It’s been a lot of learning as we go.*

(Sarah)

*I’m sure having a whole new beat would be a dramatic change, especially as you said, you can’t just chat by a veteran science reporter’s desk in the newsroom. But have you found ways of getting around that obstacle? I’ve also been struck by just how quickly the angle on this outbreak changes from week to week, even day to day, from just how many aspects of society that this crisis affects.*

(Laurel)

*Absolutely. It changes every few days. You become an expert on one thing and then the story moves along. At the beginning, there was just such an emphasis on testing. Obviously, there still is because there’s still a shortage. But we were looking at which companies are coming out with tests, and what’s the difference between the United States’ tests and German tests, and why didn’t we get those?*

*The last week or two, there’s been so much talk about the World Health Organization and how that is funded. All of a sudden, I’m becoming an expert on the funding of the World Health Organization. Now, serological testing — testing for antibodies — and trying to get a handle on if antibodies aren’t seen in the blood, what does that actually mean? And when will we know what it means? And trying to get a handle on not only how the United States is handling it, and with every state doing its own thing, but also what are other countries doing? And is it working in those places? And how do you know whether temperature and things like that, or cultural factors, come into play?*

*And as a news organization, it’s been really interesting because, distinct from anything I can remember, this is the first time where everyone is now a coronavirus reporter. Every beat, almost every story touches on the coronavirus in some way, and so it does require just a whole lot more coordination throughout the organization. Just lots of, “Here’s what we’re working on. What are you working on? Is anyone trying to do this?”*

*And of course, at NPR, we have all these member stations across the country, which is great because we really can’t leave home. A lot of our reporters, while they might be based in Washington, D.C., or somewhere generally out on the road looking for people to interview but now they’re doing phone interviews, too. I think more than ever, we’re really grateful to have all those NPR affiliates in all these different places around the country because it has just set us up really well to cover the local at a time when movement is really limited.*

(Sarah)

*Well, that’s certainly good to hear that NPR was well positioned to cover the pandemic at both local and national levels, particularly at a time when we’re seeing just an exponential expansion of news deserts in the U.S., starting with rural towns, it looks like. I’m curious to hear your thoughts about what the long-term effects of this will be in terms of public support and trust for local media and whether this might bolster people’s trust in their hometown newspaper or television and radio stations and otherwise.*

(Laurel)

*It’s a time that I think does show some of the strength of the public radio model. I think we’ve seen that play out for the last five or 10 years, actually, where there’s been such a contraction of the newspaper industry. Those newspapers are so important, and they’re important all of the time, not just during this crisis, yet the money just isn’t working, and people aren’t subscribing. People are used to getting all their news on the Internet for free, and then these big either like newspaper conglomerates or hedge funds, buy up the newspapers and then shut them down or lay off all but a skeleton crew of reporters. There’s real consequences for that, obviously. A lot of national reporters read those local newspapers on the Internet. That’s how the national reporters find out about what’s going on and how stories become national news. Without those local reporters there to cover stuff and notice it, who knows what stories just won’t be seen.*

*I think that public radio has been, who knows what the next few months or years will bring, but it has been a bright spot in the media landscape. I think we’ve seen other news startups and other news organizations copying, frankly, the public radio model where we, get sponsorship and support maybe from a local institution like a university, and then also ask the community for their support to put a price on the value that they get out of our coverage and to support it.*

*That has worked out really well and has sustained public radio stations around the country, which in turn sustains NPR. We are absolutely touched by all the economic fallout of the coronavirus, and it’s hurting NPR’s finances just as it’s hurting so many news organizations’ finances. But I do think that at times like this, certainly people may not be able to give if they’ve lost their jobs — this is probably not the year they’re going to donate to their public radio station, necessarily. But I think people really are seeing the value in local news and national news that brings them what’s happening out in the world, especially when so many people are stuck at home.*

(Sarah)

*It’s been so disheartening to see many news companies, from small outlets to large networks, mandate furloughs and turn to salary cuts from this economic fallout we’re experiencing. How have you seen NPR negotiate these financial challenges, and how has the organization changed its approach amidst a media landscape that is increasingly volatile?*

(Laurel)

*This is a time that really values flexibility, and I’ve been impressed to see how NPR, my news organization, has been able to change itself to this moment and to meet people when and where they are listening and consuming news. For NPR, we started, like within the span of a week, a new evening radio show. It’s basically an extra hour of All Things Considered called the National Conversation, which is oriented around answering the public’s questions about the coronavirus: How does it spread and how do I keep my family safe, too? How do I get a haircut right now*

*It’s live every evening, every weeknight, with a panel of experts, including NPR reporters, but also including doctors or public health officials. It’s been really cool to see NPR do that. At the same time, I’ve seen how people who, because of certain things, maybe what they typically do isn’t as needed or as possible right now. They’ve shifted into working a different job right now and doing that from home. It’s been really good to see how a place, that I think really believes in and recognizes its need for its staff, can move things around and reinvent certain things at a time like this rather than laying off people. It’s going to allow us to be able to put out the strong reporting that people need right now rather than contract and do less than we were before, and at a time when people need so much information.*

(Sarah)

*We’ll be right back.*

(Sarah)

*Many members of the Morehead-Cain community are serving on the frontlines of the pandemic. We have alumni working to combat food insecurity through meal deliveries, house health care professionals closer to their hospitals, support restaurant workers who have lost their jobs, increase access to research, and so much more. To learn how you can get involved, head to the “COVID-19 Response” page on the Morehead-Cain Network.*

*We also have a special message from Executive Director Chuck Lovelace. Here’s Chuck.*

(Chuck)

*The spring semester is over here in Chapel Hill and many scholars’ plans for the summer are still uncertain. If you are an alum or a friend and know someone who’s having a hard time amidst this pandemic, please let us know so that we can reach out. Hope to see you again soon, and until then, be safe. Thank you.*

(Sarah)

*And now back to the show.*

(Sarah)

*I was just listening to Chapel Hill’s NPR member station, WUNC, on how they released their Testing podcast, which looks at how North Carolina is dealing with COVID-19, and it’s been cool to see the creative ways that news organizations are sharing information that will help people go about their daily lives. Now, we still know so little about this novel coronavirus that I have occasionally had to distance myself from all news for a couple hours just for my own sanity. What’s the conversation at NPR of how to get this important information out to the public without freaking people out with constant death tolls and rising transmission rates and other stories related to morbidity?*

(Laurel)

*I don’t work on a show. I don’t work on Morning Edition or All Things Considered, but I do have a sense of how they work, and I’ve worked on them in the past. I think at NPR, as with most serious news organizations, you can’t change the fact that there’s bad news. Obviously, we can’t. We have a responsibility to report it, even or especially if it’s terrible. This is one of those times. At least in my mind, I haven’t heard any discussion. You can’t downplay it. This is very serious. You have to share that with people so that people do take it seriously and understand just what a situation that we’re in right now. At the same time, there’s always steps taken to balance the dark and worrying news with moments of joy. That’s been true well before the coronavirus. Before this, there’s been years of political turmoil in this country. It’s just been one thing to the next. That’s a balance that we work on striking every day. If you are listening, I think you might notice that usually at the top of the hour the first news stories, starting at eight, six a.m., tend to be the heaviest. That’s like the day’s big political news. Right now, the biggest coronavirus news and what the states are doing.*

*As it gets to the end of the hour, for the last few minutes, that’s often, either whether it’s the last five minutes or the last 20 minutes, depending on how much really serious stuff there is, that’s when there can be moments of levity. So maybe it’s an interview with a musician or an author who has a book coming out or a story on the way a local community is coming together. Those parts are in there not to distract from the seriousness of what’s going on, but to recognize that we all need something to keep us going. Something to keep us from getting into despair about all of this. I think that’s more the discussion. It’s not necessarily that we can do anything to keep people from being freaked out. All we can do is try to give them correct information as clearly communicated as clearly as possible so that people are aware of the risks and the situation, but also give them things to keep hope alive and to feel connected to others in this time when so many people are isolated.*

(Sarah)

*Laurel, thank you so much. I appreciate your time. Is there anything else you’d like to add or share with scholars who are interested in going into journalism or related fields?*

(Laurel)

*Sure. One thing I forgot to mention, you mentioned that WUNC has a new podcast about the coronavirus, and I just wanted to let folks know that NPR does as well. It’s called the Coronavirus Daily, and it’s basically the day’s top stories about the coronavirus all together in one space. I think if you are maybe especially out of your typical new schedule but want to make sure you’re keeping up on everything, that can be a great way to do it.*

*In terms of advice for scholars, I really feel terrible for them that the Summer Enrichment Program is largely on hold this year. That really hit home for me to see that news because I just know how big a part of the experience that is. I know that NPR had to cancel its internship program for this summer and that’s really tough on students who are trying to figure out where they want to go in life.*

*But I just would say that there are such interesting opportunities that are arising right now, and so this is a good time to look for stories in your own community if you’re at home and interesting things are happening in your town. This is a great chance to document that in some way. You can always reach out to your local news organization while you’re at home or a bigger one that you admire and say, “Hey, this is going on here,” and offer up a perspective. Write an op-ed. I think people are just really curious about other people’s experiences right now, knowing that there’s so much variation. This is a good time to tap into the unique experiences that folks might be having or what they’re sad to be missing out on or what their worries or fears or hopes are. Share that in some way and just see where that goes. And yeah, thanks for talking with me.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you for listening to Catalyze. I’m your host, Sarah O’Carroll, and that was Laurel Wamsley, a reporter for NPR.*

*Lastly, over the weekend, Carolina virtually celebrated the class of 2020, so I’m going to end today’s episode with a message for our graduating seniors from Robbie Bach, Class of 1984.*

(Robbie)

*Cheers to the Class of 2020.*

*Even though you are graduating from Carolina under difficult circumstances, there are several things I hope you will remember.*

*You have changed the UNC community and made it greater and better than when you discovered it.*

*You have touched the lives of family, friends, faculty, Morehead-Cain team members, and so many others in a positive way.*

*You have studied and grown and probably a great deal more than you ever thought possible.*

*You have created friendships and bonds that will endure, and in fact, last a lifetime.*

*And you will join the Tar Heel family forever.*

*Congratulations on a great four years.*

*And yes, I’m gone to Carolina in my mind.*

(Sarah)

*That was from Robbie Bach in honor of our graduating seniors and in memory of Wynn Burrus. That concludes today’s show. Thank you to Jakob Hamilton, Class of 2019, for recording this song for us. Until next time, Morehead-Cains, stay safe and stay well.*

\*This episode has been edited slightly for clarity.

# Gowri Abhinanda ’26 on advocating for gun violence prevention policy
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Gowri Abhinanda ’26

Gowri Abhinanda ’26 has sought to amplify youth voices on gun violence prevention since eighth grade, when the 2018 Parkland shooting twenty minutes away from her home shook her South Florida community.

In high school, the scholar organized peaceful demonstrations to raise awareness of gun violence and founded school and city chapters for youth-led organizations.

Reading about the shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, in 2022 further galvanized Gowri to organize a rally in her community, Weston, Florida, before continuing her activism at UNC–Chapel Hill, she said.

“As students, scribbling ‘advocate for our lives and common-sense legislation’ to our agendas in between calculus and essays is tiresome, but I find it incredibly hard to look away when elementary students are being killed,” said Gowri, a political science and journalism double major.

The scholar served the organization [Brady: United Against Gun Violence](https://www.bradyunited.org/) for two years as part of Team ENOUGH, the nonprofit’s youth-led initiative. She led a lobbying cohort to reach elected officials in support of gun violence prevention reforms in Florida.

This past semester, Gowri represented the nonprofit to meet with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to advocate for reducing gun violence in the country. The scholar attended a [roundtable discussion on gun violence prevention](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/01/11/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-before-a-roundtable-discussion-on-gun-violence-prevention-charlotte-nc/) at Eastway Middle School in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Gowri delivered a letter to Vice President Harris at the event with ideas and calls to action after thanking her for the administration’s work on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a major federal gun safety bill passed in 2022.

“My hope is that continued widespread advocacy from young people will urge our leaders to act in favor of our futures and our safety,” the scholar said.

The recent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, which killed one and injured two others, “highlights the necessity for more reform,” according to Gowri.

Missing from the national conversation has been how to implement effective reform, and the fact that the event was a mass shooting, she said.

“A former president being shot is appalling. How many more appalling events need to happen until we act?”

Gowri is the vice president of the Asian American Student Association at Carolina.

# Documentary produced by Anna Connors ’24, Aayas Joshi ’26 tracks last remaining wild herd of American bison in Yellowstone
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

An independent documentary by Anna Connors ’24 and Aayas Joshi ’26 tells the history of the dwindling buffalo population in the Yellowstone, Montana, region and the factors that threaten the species’ survival.

The 13-minute film, [The Last Wild Herd: Defending Yellowstone’s Buffalo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWnVlx3Q9gk), features voices from the [Buffalo Field Campaign (BFC)](https://www.buffalofieldcampaign.org/). The nonprofit has advocated for nearly three decades for the preservation and protection of buffalo.

The American bison was named the country’s national mammal in 2016, yet the “persecution and near-extinction levels of slaughter they’ve faced tell a different story,” Aayas said. An estimated 5,000 buffalo currently live in Yellowstone, down from the millions that once freely roamed the continent, according to the scholar.

“Bison are regularly subjected to hazing operations, brutal quarantine procedures, slaughter, domestication, and political pressure by the cattle industry,” he said.

Their survival continues to be threatened by government management policies, Anna added, that “prioritize the desires of the cattle industry over native wildlife, and, in turn, deprioritize the desires of Native American Indian tribes.”

Aayas and Anna had originally set out to focus on northern Rocky Mountain gray wolves, [an endangered species](https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/wolf-restoration.htm). During the early stages of their research, however, the team connected with James Holt, a member of the Nez Perce Tribe and the Buffalo Field Campaign’s executive director.

Learning about the organization and its mission and history inspired them to focus on buffalo, which have historically received less media attention than wolves, Anna said.

“When we arrived and began to spend time at BFC, we realized we’d be doing ourselves a disservice to not at least focus part of our project on buffalo,” said the scholar, who shot, edited, and produced the film with Aayas through the [2023 Rich Beckman Documentary Award](index-114.html) and the [Morehead-Cain Global Perspective summer](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/summer-programs/global-perspective/).

The two spent a month in and around Yellowstone National Park, interviewing local activists, volunteers, and leaders of indigenous communities.

The film aims to shed light on a culturally significant species to native tribes and “the sociocultural prejudices that influence our interactions with the natural world,” said Aayas, a photographer and videographer on the Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team.

“Our hope with the documentary is to inform people about the issue and amplify the amazing work done by the Buffalo Field Campaign,” he said. “We are honored to have crossed paths with all those who have been working tirelessly to defend Yellowstone’s bison, and we hope that our project can help contribute to the cause.”

The project was supported by the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media and the Morehead-Cain Foundation’s [Summer Enrichment Program](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/summer-programs/global-perspective/) and [Lovelace Fund for Discovery](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/lovelace-fund-for-discovery/).

# Advocating for elephant welfare in Sri Lanka
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Maya takes care of Mali, an elephant at the foundation, each day.

For her Global Perspective summer, Maya DeCoux ’26 is volunteering with the [Elephant Care Relief Foundation](https://www.elephantcarerelief.com/) in Sri Lanka. The scholar fundraises for rescues, advocates for the ethical treatment of elephants in government-owned facilities, and provides direct care for elephants.

The scholar said she was interested in working with the nonprofit to enhance the lives of domesticated elephants.

“This ongoing journey deepens my commitment to animal advocacy, ethical treatment practices, and mindfulness,” she said.

In addition to elephant welfare, the scholar has been participating in Buddhist meditation sessions and mindfulness retreats guided by monks and nuns at local temples.

The experiences have shaped her “pursuit of mindfulness, inner peace, and happiness” while “minimizing personal greed and negativity,” she said.

Maya has also volunteered in environmental initiatives, such as rehabilitating injured turtles for their release into the wild at [The Green Lion](https://thegreenlion.net/) and teaching English at local schools.

“Through direct experience and cultural immersion, I continue to gain invaluable insights into sustainable conservation and personal growth, fostering connections that will guide my future endeavors in global welfare and mindfulness advocacy,” the double major in psychology and neuroscience said.

The [Global Perspective](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/summer-programs/global-perspective/) summer is an opportunity to conduct an independent research project or learn about a new sector or part of the world through a more traditional internship.

# Designing 3D-printed prosthetics in Salt Lake City, Utah
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

For his Professional Experience summer, Jake Rose ’26 is working at [Handspring](https://www.myhandspring.com/), a prosthetic clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah.

As part of his internship, the scholar designed a 3D-printed arm and elbow system for a shoulder disarticulation and assisted in the creation of a prosthetic that can be used for rock climbing.

The scholar said he’s been able to “experience the entire prosthetic process” at Handspring, from participating in patient meetings to product design, manufacturing, and final delivery. The clinic develops specialized devices for patients with highly specific requirements.

“The ability to brainstorm directly with the patient to bring their goals and feedback to life within minutes is an incredibly unique opportunity that I have enjoyed immensely,” he said.

Jake has also been able to experience the beauty of the southwest United States through weekend backpacking trips.

“I’ve grown my passion for photography and captured beautiful environments while appreciating the vast and empty landscapes, he said.”

In the [Professional Experience](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/summer-programs/professional-experience/) summer, scholars begin to explore the transition from Carolina to the working world by pursuing a professional internship.

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*So first off, how are you, and how are you coping with all of this? For our listeners, we’re recording the week that Carolina announced all undergraduate instruction would shift to remote learning. Greear, I understand you’re in Raleigh, and have been remote since the start of the semester, is that right?*

(Greear)

*That’s right, all of my professors decided ultimately to shift their classes online. And so obviously, it’s not the start to the semester that I was hoping for or really wanted, but doing the best that I can with what I’ve got right now.*

(Sarah)

*Well, it seems like you’ve had a very busy summer. Can you share some of the work you’ve been doing locally, including the Raleigh Demands Justice event and how all that came together?*

(Greear)

*Yes, sure. So Raleigh Demands Justice came on the heels of the horrific murder, the public murder of George Floyd. And we really felt like we needed to do something here in the capital city of North Carolina. So we stood in solidarity and reached out to organizers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and other cities, Chicago and New York, and did kind of a virtual meeting.*

*And then we launched right into it. Within a few days of the murder and all of the public outcry surrounding George Floyd, we hosted a peaceful protest and a five thousand strong march in downtown Raleigh. So I was proud to be one of the organizers of that. And there were many fellow youth that helped organize that march.*

*It was very empowering and inspiring, of course, \[due to\] such an unfortunate circumstance. But we really wanted to push for change and show that we were strong and unified here in North Carolina in standing with Minneapolis. After Raleigh Demands Justice, that initial march, we continued to keep the pressure up on our local officials here in Raleigh, even turning our attention to some statewide officials.*

*And even today, we continue to press for certain policies when it comes to police transformation and keeping our community safe. I was able to do that as part of my role as co-founder of Young Americans Protest, which started after the North Carolina Town Hall, an event back in 2018 that some students in my county created to really address why students were not included in the conversation surrounding gun violence and school shootings.*

*So after that event, we worked with some community leaders, with some other students, with some teachers even, and really thought about what would be the best way to continue advocating. Alongside two friends of mine, we co-founded Young Americans Protest and are continuing to give youth that voice in politics today.*

(Sarah)

*Can you take us into that process for a bit and just how that collaboration takes place at the local and regional level, and then even in partnering with other groups across the country?*

(Greear)

*Sure, so how it works at the local level first is really just building community and establishing those relationships and continuing to engage, continuing to have constant discussion about what needs to change, what needs to be done, and making things personal.*

*I always try and add the personal touch and ask people to really reflect and think about, what would you do if the person in this unfortunate circumstance, an unjust circumstance or violent circumstance, was someone that you knew or someone that you were related to? How would you act? What kind of action, what kind of justice would you like to see and go from there? And so building that community is so important as well, being able to establish relationships here with those teachers, with pastors, with those who are in elected office and really say, “Hey, I want to make a difference. I may not be in elected office, but I want to do my part as a community member to be civically engaged and active.”*

*That’s that first step. And so that’s what it looks like at the community level for me, locally and for many of my peers. Now when you talk about the national level, when you talk about collaborating with other cities and specifically other states in the United States, we really have to think about the different dynamics that are at play.*

*For North Carolina, of course, it’s not only a political battleground state, but it’s also a very diverse state with the largest Native American population east of the Mississippi River. We have a pretty strong population of black folks here in the state. And so to understand that all of that plays into activism and organizing, and understand how communities work, is super important.*

*So we took lead and consulted with other organizations, mainly through social media. We had people reach out to Young Americans Protest and say, “Hey, this is what worked here. This is what didn’t work.” And we went from there. And so, again, that was collaboration with other cities in North Carolina, but also other states that reached out to us and said, “I saw this on social media. How would you advise that we do this? And how would you advise us that we act in a way that will actually lead to change?”*

*A lot of folks now are taking on this phrase of “performative activism” and that’s being thrown around a lot. That’s going to marches, going to protests or speaking up, posting on social media, posting cool pictures at a protest and then never really following up, and kind of disappearing after that May 30th date of the massive protests around the nation for George Floyd. We want to enact things that lead to lasting change, and so that’s where collaboration and building that community really comes into play.*

(Sarah)

*Now, knowing that anything can happen and thinking about the takeaways from the summer with what worked well and what could perhaps use some refining, how are you thinking about your activism work for what may be ahead?*

(Greear)

*That’s right. I mean, you hit it right on the head. Anything can happen and there are many variables, many things that shift and that will shift and change as we move closer to November and even beyond. And so the way that I think about it, again, is just cultivating those relationships and following up.*

*The follow up is important and that’s why timelines are also important. When you talk about activism, when you talk about not only organizing, but wanting to see a visible, tangible change, you’ve got to put a timeline on it. And so that’s what we did. We had a list of demands here in Raleigh when it came to police brutality and police accountability. We really didn’t want to just reform the Raleigh Police Department, but we wanted to transform the Raleigh Police Department, and give a new role and a new vision for community safety here and one that could be modeled across the state.*

*We had about seven demands. We had a timeline for some of those demands. Some of the timelines were met, and some of them weren’t. We had to regroup and follow up. And so I’m proud to say we have seen some change here at the local level by our city and county leaders. But we’re looking for more. And so the way that we’re going to do that, especially in these times of a global pandemic, we’re really going to have to use social media and virtual advocacy to follow up.*

*We have already seen letters that have been sent by local leaders to state legislators asking for certain powers. We have the creation of a Raleigh police advisory board, which is a plus.*

*So as we begin to see this change occur, we have to make sure that we keep our eyes on the prize, which is complete and total justice, and that we continue to give these people in positions of great power deadlines and timelines so that we can have our solutions and our demands met.*

(Sarah)

*Now all of this, of course, goes hand-in-hand with your work this summer as a voter mobilization ambassador through the Graduate School of Education at Harvard. What else have you learned so far, and how have you been able to implement that knowledge and skillset in encouraging other young people to get out to the polls this November?*

(Greear)

*Yes, Harvard’s Making Caring Common Voter Mobilization and Civic Engagement Program has really been a great opportunity, and I am thankful for the opportunity to have been selected and to work with many of my peers, a few even at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, to really become those community leaders as we head up to the election of November 3rd.*

*That program wrapped up at the end of August but it involved many speakers. We’ve had people that served as communications experts for President George Bush, for President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. We’ve had people that worked with Stacey Abrams at her Fair Fight campaign to protect people’s votes. We’ve had people that worked in the Obama White House come and really speak to us about what it means for youth to lead the charge when it comes to voter mobilization and getting our communities energized. I mean, there’s a common phrase out there and it just says that “the youth will lead.” And that is so true. And this Making Caring Common program in putting humanity first has been a great first step for that.*

*So along with the speakers, who gave us their expertise each week, we’ve been able to also speak with each other again across the nation, about 100 hundred other youth, and be able to really discuss and break down strategy and what we’re going to do moving forward, also in the age of the coronavirus. But what we’re going to do virtually and in person is to make sure that every vote gets counted this November.*

(Sarah)

*Is there anything else you’d want to pass along to Morehead-Cain Scholars and students at Carolina with what people should consider doing this fall to be more civically engaged in general? What are some things they can definitively do, whether online or in person?*

(Greear)

*Sure, I would definitely say that anyone can do it, anyone can lead, anyone can inspire their community. I don’t have all the answers. Nobody has the perfect solutions when it comes to activism or when it comes to speaking up and using your voice for good. But if you always center on people, and doing what’s right and what’s best to elevate people and their value and their mission and their goals, that is where true success comes.*

*Building those relationships and building that community, like I talked about, is super important, as well as just believing in yourself and being willing to reach out and ask for help. I know I have, and I certainly encourage others to go to those who have gone before you, those who may be experts in the field, even those just in the community that may have an opinion but may not be willing to speak up or may want to talk with you one-on-one and say, “Hey, I like how you’re doing this, but I wish you’d go about this in a different way,” or “Hey, here are just my ideas in general on this issue,” and really taking those to heart and believing in yourself and believing in the power of help. And being able to use everything within your means to go and make change, and being courageous.*

*It’s definitely tough sometimes. It’s certainly draining, especially when you look at cases like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, when you look at race in general, just knowing this country’s historical background, it is draining. So I also encourage people to take time for themselves, take time to not only unplug, but to recharge and to get back out there and make sure that you’re centered with yourself and with those who whom you want to speak up for.*

(Sarah)

*There seems to be a real risk of exhaustion, not just physically, but emotionally and mentally from doing this sort of work. Have you picked up any effective coping mechanisms and strategies for managing all of this at a personal level?*

(Greear)

*Yeah, that’s a great question. Burnout is really a concern when you talk about activism and organizing and just fighting for others. Again, not only knowing the historical background of this country, but recognizing you and your position, whether it’s your privilege or whether it’s all of the burden that comes with being you. And so as a black man myself and going through this process of working with others and in some cases leading others, it’s very draining.*

*You definitely have to have that self care in place. Sometimes that takes detaching from social media, not watching the news all the time. Maybe just going and watching your favorite Netflix show. It could look like, you know, taking out the phone and chatting with somebody you haven’t talked to in a while just to take your mind off of super serious things.*

*That’s why I like to use the term recharge, because unplug is a term that people use often. While that gets the point across, you don’t have to fully disengage from what’s going on or what you’re passionate about. But you do need to take time to make sure, like I said, that centered, that you’re empowered, and that you’re ready to go and give it your all. And you can’t do that if you’re constantly drained and consistently feeling as though you have nothing left to give.*

*So, again, taking time to call up somebody you haven’t talked to in a while, be present in family gatherings or family experiences, certainly watching a Netflix show, or even go on social media and specifically look for things that may not be activism-focused or issue-based. Those are all examples that I give to people and that have been passed on to me by my mentors, which I’m grateful for.*

*Exercise is another great outlet, and it’s just important that you really take time to make sure that you’re ready to go for the next fight and for the battle. That can only be done when you’re at your best.*

(Sarah)

*Well, Greear, really appreciate your time. I’m sure your actions and words will encourage all of us and remind folks that everyone has a degree of efficacy in enacting change and that your voice matters.*

(Greear)

*You hit it right there on the head. Students voices do matter. Young people’s voices do matter. At the forefront of every generational battle and every every issue-based movement here in the United States have been youth. And the civil rights movement is one that many look to a lot. Just understand that, we can do it, we can continue to fight for better, and fight for more, and fight for justice, is so important. And the youth have a major stake in that.*

*I’m excited when I look around and see not only myself, but my peers being willing to be those community builders, being willing to hold adults and those given certain powers accountable. That’s where true change is going to come.*

*And I’m hopeful. It’s tough sometimes to be hopeful, but I am. And so I would just encourage everyone to also be hopeful and continue to be courageous and use your voice and speak out. Definitely make sure you’re taking care of yourself. But we can do this for sure.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you so much.*

(Greear)

*Thank you.*

# Global Perspective Spotlight: Searching for the “heart of golf” in the United States and Scotland, with Jake Patterson ’25
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Jake Patterson ’25 with professional golfer Alyaa Abdulghany

For his Global Perspective summer, Jake Patterson ’25 is traveling throughout the United States and Scotland “on a search for the heart of golf.”

The scholar has been caddying on the Epson Tour for Alyaa Abdulghany, a professional golfer.

The scholar said creating lifelong relationships with people he’s met along the way has been the most meaningful aspect of the summer.

“Golf is more than a score: it’s a dynamic experience that brings so many fascinating people together,” he said. “I’m thankful to the Morehead-Cain Foundation for giving me the support to catalyze these relationships and gain an up-close understanding of what makes golf so special, at all levels.”

Parker Prysiazniuk ’25 went to Berlin, Germany, this summer to serve as the head delegation liaison for Special Olympics Perú through a [Lovelace Fund for Discovery](https://www.moreheadcain.org/scholar-experience/lovelace-fund-for-discovery/) grant. The Special Olympics World Games began on June 17 and go through June 25.

Parker has been involved with the Special Olympics for nearly eight years, starting as a coach and mentor in his hometown of Mocksville, North Carolina.

“My fervor for working with individuals with intellectual disabilities has since grown exponentially, and I am beyond grateful for the opportunity to take my commitment from local to national and global levels,” Parker said. “Being around athletes from 190 delegations around the world is awe-inspiring, and I am excited to be alongside Olimpiadas Espesicales Perú for the rest of the Games. ¡Vamos Perú!”

Following the Games, Parker will complete his Global Perspective summer in Kumasi, Ghana, to conduct public health research for the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and volunteer for the Eleos Cares Foundation, a nonprofit that supports community healthcare projects worldwide.

Prior to Germany, Parker took a stop-out year to travel solo through South and Central America and complete a NOLS India course through the Himalayas. He’ll rejoin the scholar community on campus this fall.

# Scholar cohort completes year-long Dialogue & Discourse program
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

The Dialogue and Discourse program finished with a retreat at the Rizzo Center in Chapel Hill from March 22 to March 24.

The inaugural Dialogue and Discourse experience for junior and senior scholars concluded in March. The year-long program was designed to build capacity for leadership and communication on complex issues.

Launched last fall, the program was led by Bill Isaacs and Skip Griffin of [Dialogos](https://www.dialogos.com/), a strategic dialogue and leadership development consulting firm.

Nigel Parker ’25 said the program strengthened him through a “practice of self reflection.”

“My experience has inspired me to deepen my relationships with myself, my fellow scholars, and my community at large,” he said. “I am grateful for the wisdom of the scholars who experienced this program with me, as well as for Skip and Bill for facilitating and guiding this special group.”

For Roariker Swenson ’25, Dialogue and Discourse grew his understanding of the “power of deep empathy in disagreement.”

“We often forget that, during most arguments, we both have the same end goal and simply envision different paths to its successful achievement,” the junior said. “As someone who studies Chinese and Russian, and who wants to build a career around building bridges and deepening cross-cultural understanding, this experience has been profound in helping me shape new strategies and frameworks for peace building.”

Morehead-Cain is grateful to the alumni who supported the Dialogue and Discourse program.

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*John, thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me.*

(John)

*It’s my pleasure. Thank you, Sarah.*

(Sarah)

*I first wanted to ask, as a political scientist, have you ever experienced, or have you ever predicted, these past three and a half plus years? You’re one of the authors of the book, “Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America,” where you and your colleagues analyzed the role that voters’ racial and ethnic identities played in Donald Trump’s victory. So I’m curious to hear how you’ve made sense of this topsy turvy political world, having followed the last presidential election run up so closely.*

(John)

*Well, I think there’s things that are normal and things that are abnormal. For a lot of political scientists and political analysts, aspects of the Trump administration, the Trump presidency, have often times been very unusual. Trump’s approach to governance, and the challenges his administration has had, are much different and arguably larger than I think traditionally presidents have had, of course, culminating in impeachment, which is not something most presidents experience. I think you can see some of those challenges and difficulties in how they’ve tried to manage the coronavirus pandemic, or, of course, according to their critics, not manage the pandemic. I think it points to the challenges of having a president and many of the president’s advisers who don’t have a lot of experience or necessarily a lot of knowledge about the public policy issues and challenges confronting the country even before the pandemic.*

*At the same time, some of the things that have happened have been consistent with normal relative to what we think of as the baseline of American politics: the extent of partisan polarization that we’ve seen between Democrats and Republicans, including in their views of the president, but also in terms of how the parties in Congress have worked together or not worked together. Those are those kinds of things are very much continuations of a trend or a continuation of a pattern.*

*And we’re also seeing right now with Trump, his approval rating has declined over the last several months, which is very much consistent with the typical pattern when the president confronts national problems and crises and can’t easily or effectively respond to those problems and crises, then there is a segment of the public that holds the president accountable for that, fairly or unfairly.*

*Some of the challenges that the president is facing in getting re-elected reflect just the challenges of being the president in the middle of a recession and a pandemic. And I don’t think that’s as unusual as Trump is as a chief executive, I don’t think what he’s experiencing right now is anything all that unusual.*

(Sarah)

*Surely a lot of us did not predict a global pandemic of this scale to occur in 2020, among many other crises we’ve seen take place this year. But based on your research and observations, do your findings from the book help us predict at all, or understand, what might happen in the November election between Trump and Biden?*

(John)

*Yeah, so I think there’s several things that are going to most likely have parallels between this election and the last. I mean, one is that you’re going to see a lot of strong partisanship. The vast majority of Democrats are going to vote for Joe Biden and the vast majority of Republicans are going to vote for Donald Trump. And in fact, this kind of partisan loyalty has arguably put both a floor and a ceiling on what we can expect in terms of the percentage of Americans who approve of the president, the percentage of Americans who vote Republican or Democratic in a presidential election. Without that kind of strong partisanship, Trump’s approval rating might have fallen even further or Joe Biden might be able to win an even larger percentage of the vote. So I think that’s a very consistent feature of American elections generally.*

*But of the last two cycles in particular, one of the other things that we talk a lot about in the book, and this is why it’s called “Identity Crisis,” is because in the 2016 election, there was a lot of the politics of that election that focused on issues around racial, ethnic, religious and national identity. So debates around race and policing, debates around immigration, for example, both Trump and Clinton contributed to that discussion because they both talked about those issues. But, of course, much of that attention and a lot of the controversy came in response to things that Trump said in talking about those issues.*

*I think one of the things that you can see already in 2020 is that without the ability to sort of promote the country’s economic health, which was what I think he originally planned to do, he’s turned again to similar themes, similar criticisms of immigrants and immigration, his reaction to the killing of George Floyd in the protests surrounding that, his reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement generally. All of those reflect a similar kind of discourse around identity that sort of sharply characterize the country in this kind of “us and them” framework, and that’s very much what he was doing in 2015 and 2016.*

*The difference is that he’s now confronting these big national problems, which are front and center in Americans’ daily lives and their priorities for the country and their government. And it’s not quite clear whether changing the subject to focus on, let’s say, the dangers of the protesters in Portland, Oregon, is really enough to keep people from thinking more about the challenges the country is facing and whether or not the incoming administration bears some responsibility for those things.*

(Sarah)

*Switching to the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris ticket, do you have any thoughts on how the vice presidential running mate, who, of course, is biracial, may affect voter participation among certain demographics this November, having tracked these sort of variables for the last election?*

(John)

*Yeah, it’s a good question. I mean, we don’t really have a great amount of data to speak to this because she’s a singular figure. We haven’t had a vice presidential candidate who identifies as an African-American woman. I do think that there are a number of people within the Democratic Party who are leaders and sort of activists within the party who feel strongly that as the party has transformed, such that something like 40 percent of self-identified Democrats are not white, that the leadership of the party needs to reflect that. And when that leadership doesn’t reflect that, it runs the risk of failing to engage and mobilize communities within the party that are communities of color.*

*I don’t know whether the racial and ethnic background of the vice presidential nominee is going to prove to be a major motivating factor. I mean, that’s one of the hypotheses that I think is going to be great to test and figure out when the election’s over. But I do think that increasingly it’s difficult for the Democratic Party symbolically to offer leadership that merely reflects politicians who are white, politicians who are white men. And so you can see in the selection of Harris the way in which the Democratic Party has evolved.*

*I should also note one of the things that we talked about in our book that we could see in the run up to 2016, but even since 2016, even in the short time that we had to look at data after the election, the Democratic Party’s not just changing in terms of what percentage of the party is white or non-white, it’s changing in terms of the way that the party thinks about issues related to race and civil rights and immigration, and not just because there’s more people who are immigrants themselves or children of immigrants and the like, but it’s because white Democrats, white native-born Democrats have become more liberal on these issues. And events like the killing of Floyd helped to further that.*

*So if you look at the attitudes of white Democrats now compared to where they were 20 or 30 years ago, they’re just simply much more consistently liberal and progressive on issues of civil rights. And so to some extent, the selection of Harris reflects a set of values that are shared not just among Democrats who are people of Color, but among white Democrats as well.*

(Sarah)

*We’ll be right back.*

(Sarah)

*This fall, starting next week, Morehead-Cains will share their thoughts and experiences on a range of topics, including managing financial debt, parenting during a pandemic, and how to design a meaningful gap year. The first event, called “A Polarized America: Saving the Art of Agreeable Disagreement,” is on Wednesday, September 9th, at 4 P.M. EDT. You can view the full slate of events on the MCN.*

(Sarah)

*And now back to the show.*

(Sarah)

*I now want to ask you some questions about the post office. From your perspective, just how real is the threat to our next election that we’re reading about in the news with respect to the post office’s potential implosion? And how concerned should we be as we see all these headlines about the institution’s woes? And in what specific ways should we be concerned?*

(John)

*One of the things that’s clearly concerning is the way in which voting by mail has been mischaracterized as simply a channel for fraud. And there’s just simply very, very little evidence of any kind of voter fraud, whether that’s people misrepresenting who they are and voting in person, whether that’s people stealing or otherwise trying to sort of fill out absentee ballots or mail ballots in ways that obviously don’t reflect who they are or the fact that they might be ineligible to vote. So all of these things that seek to sort of place restrictions on voting in service of preventing fraud are mostly solutions in search of a problem. That to me is a very concerning thing.*

*The other thing that’s concerning is that there’s a lack of clarity around the distinction between different kinds of mail-in voting. There are a handful of states that either already provide every citizen with a ballot that they send via the mail or are going to do that now because of the pandemic. The vast majority of states do not do that. The vast majority of states require the voter to request a ballot and then upon request, that ballot is mailed into them. So this distinction has been obscured in some of the statements of the president and some other commentators.*

*The system of requesting a ballot and having one sent to you is not anything controversial. The president requested absentee ballots to vote in Florida. We need to be clear that when we’re talking about voting by mail in the 2020 election, mostly we’re talking about a system of absentee voting that’s been in place for a long time. It’s nothing new. It’s likely not going to produce any worse outcomes than it produced before. So those are two pieces of misinformation that have to be worked on the issues around the post office.*

*To some extent, what this reflects is a central challenge in the way that America administers elections. We administer elections largely by delegating authority to states and to localities to make decisions, and the states and localities can make very different decisions depending on who the policymakers are in those states. The situation with the post office is the rare opportunity, therefore, for the federal government to get involved in some form or fashion. And here, again, this should not be a difficult issue or problem. The Postal Service has the capacity to deliver the current amount of mail volume that we have in this country. And they have the capacity to handle additional volume that might come from ballots.*

*Anything that places that at risk is at risk of denying some Americans their democratic right to express their choice in an election. At the end of the day, how many ballots would likely be affected and with what impact if the Postal Service were to continue with these restrictions? It’s unclear. Would it be enough to decide the fate of the election? Probably not. But even if it doesn’t, it’s still a challenge. It’s still a problem just from the standpoint of the principles and ideals that we should aspire to as a democracy.*

*One of the things that I think is most harmful about the way we discuss voting in this country is this presumption that anything that we do to make voting easier automatically benefits Democrats. And the political science literature has not shown that to be the case. We have had states move to all-mail elections states like Oregon, and it has not produced some sea change such that Democrats get more votes and win more elections. Most election reforms don’t have those kinds of large partisan consequences.*

*I think a really useful thing for the country would be for us, both Democrats and Republicans, to come to understand that that’s the case. And we could then maybe build a broader coalition around a set of policies at the local, state, and federal level that might that might make voting easier without politicians fearing that they’re going to lose office as a consequence of it.*

(Sarah)

*So even if some of the potential problems we’re reading about, such as the concern about capacity, are not as well understood as they could or should be, are you worried about the sort of net effect that this overall sense of confusion and even distrust of the Postal Service as an institution may affect voting come November?*

(John)

*Yeah, I would say that I think the concern that I have is not specifically that this affects trust in the post office, per say, but that this just affects trust and the American electoral process generally. All of these controversies, you know, for people to fear that the outcome is illegitimate or to believe that the outcome is illegitimate. And I mean, the worst case scenario, I think that people are entertaining, and this gets back to your questions about what’s been unusual about the Trump presidency, is that Trump himself may not acknowledge the election’s outcome as legitimate and may use this kind of misinformation about vote by mail or absentee voting to suggest that if he loses, that this was somehow the result solely of fraud and he is the true winner. And democracies depend to a large extent on the consent of the losing candidate and the losing party so that you can acknowledge that loss and then live to fight another day in the next election. And when democracies sort of fail to get the consent of the losers, right, that’s when the risks of actual violence or conflict increase.*

*What I worry about when we have these debates and about the role of the post office and all of that, I worry that it’s creating a fear of the American distrust, the American electoral process that’s not warranted. I don’t necessarily think that that means people won’t vote. I mean, I think they vote for a lot of other reasons. But I do worry that when they don’t think their vote is going to be counted or when they think that when their side loses is because the other side cheated, that’s the stuff that concerns me the most. I want people to have the confidence that the system can work well. I want the system to be reformed to increase that confidence. And I want people who don’t win to acknowledge that the reason they lost wasn’t because the other side cheated. That would be the ideal world. I’m not optimistic that’s going to happen anytime soon. But that’s the concern that I have when I see the fear that some politicians have tried to instill around mail voting and stuff like that.*

(Sarah)

*What would you say about the value of a vote? In 2016, Colin Kaepernick said it would be hypocritical of him to vote, with this idea that the system is so flawed and oppressive to begin with, particularly with respect to Black Americans, that participating in that system through voting would not be a good use of time. In contrast, we have Representative John Lewis, who a true champion for voting for many. So I just want to hear from you in a post, Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission world, to what extent does a single vote matter?*

(John)

*There are people who may choose not to vote because of their sincere sense that the system has ignored them. And that’s a political statement in its own right. And we have that right as citizens where we have the right to use that abstention, right, as a way of communicating voice. And I think there are, of course, justified concerns with the electoral and political system that we have. The way I interpreted Congressman Lewis’s remarks and the record he built over the course of his life was that it’s a belief, first and foremost, fundamentally, in the right to vote. So this opportunity needs to be legally protected and not constrained or limited in a variety of ways.*

*One thing that I would say if I were talking to students, I’m not going to sit there and pretend to tell them that if millions and millions of Americans vote, their one vote counts in the sense that it determines the outcome of the election, that’s clearly not going to be the case, but the extent to which groups within society do or do not have that legal right has a tremendous influence on the extent to which their concerns are heard and to which government is responsive to their needs and problems. And there’s lots of evidence for this, that politicians are more responsive to groups that vote in higher numbers.*

*And so I think part of the message has to be, not that the system is perfect and not that your vote picks the winner, but that collectively, when you add people who share your goals and values participate in politics, it increases the likelihood that you’re going to be listened to and you’re going to get a response. You’re going to get a set of public policies that benefit you. And that’s why I think that the value in voting oftentimes comes from your small contribution to that overall process rather than your arguably infinitesimal contribution to who wins the election.*

(Sarah)

*Finally, in the interest of time, I just wanted to close with a question about your work with The Washington Post. You’re one of the co-founders of The Monkey Cage. And now as a publisher, how is the outlet planning on approaching political coverage this fall? And what questions are you all asking right now?*

(John)

*Sure. I mean, I’ll just say a little bit about The Monkey Cage and how it approaches its work. We’re a site that publishes analysis by social scientists and particularly political scientists, and that’s based on the premise that there’s important ideas and expertise that academics have, but they don’t often have the ability to share with a broader audience outside of universities. So what we’re trying to do is give scholars a forum to communicate.*

*When we’re thinking about the 2020 election, there’s a lot of interesting and important questions that scholars can shed light on. Of course, a lot of that has to do with the attitudes of voters, with the choices that they plan to make and will ultimately make over the fall culminating in Election Day. But we’re also interested in some of the very things that we’ve discussed in this conversation, like what are the challenges confronting the way that we design and hold elections in this country with regard to absentee balloting or vote by mail? What percentage of Americans who mail a ballot and have that vote rejected, and why? And who is more likely to have their ballot rejected? How can we improve the process to make that less likely? Political scientists are oftentimes able to provide very specific and useful expertise and guidance on these kinds of questions in the aftermath of the election.*

*There’s going to be a lot of conversation on The Monkey Cage and elsewhere, just about big topics and political reform. This is particularly true if President Trump loses and and we’re moving toward a Biden administration. No one who looks at politics thinks it works very well, that was true before President Trump, and it certainly has been true over the last several years. And so this give me a lot of ideas that are going to be discussed about, let’s say, the relative balance of power among the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary, how we should think about the power of the executive branch and the privileges of the executive branch and whether those need to be curtailed in certain ways or whether the legislature and the judiciary are able to do enough to provide checks o the executive as the founders intended. There’s just no end of things that we can publish and write about.*

*It would be nice, actually, if there were fewer things, because that means the news would be a little more quiet for a change and we could all live in some peace but I don’t see that happening. And so hopefully we’ll continue to be able to use the research and the ideas of these scholars to shed some light on these important questions.*

(Sarah)

*We’ll have to closely follow The Monkey Cage and I’ll drop the link in the episode description. Thank you so much again, I really appreciate it.*

(John)

*Thank you very much, Sarah. Take care.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Niki Shamdasani ’15 on launching Sani, bringing South Asian formalwear to Rent the Runway
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Each Sani piece is ethically made in India.

The Catalyze podcast returns with Season Four, headlining with Niki Shamdasani ’15, the co-founder and CEO of Sani Designs.

People told Niki and her sister, Ritika, that they were “delusional” for aspiring to break into the fashion world with South Asian formalwear. But in the past two years, the sisters have proved the naysayers wrong in big ways.

Sani recently launched a partnership with Rent the Runway, a fashion subscription service for luxury items, to increase access to Indian occasion wear for women across the globe. In between business trips, Niki stopped by the Foundation in Chapel Hill to share the news and what’s next for the startup.

Niki graduated with a political science major and business administration minor from Carolina.

You can learn more about the company on their [website](https://sanidesigns.com/) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sani/), and you can [shop Sani’s styles on Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/pages/designers/sani/products?filters%5Bzip_code%5D=27701&sort=recommended). The Sani Fashion Show, previously scheduled for April 5 as a benefit event for UNC Children’s Hospital, has been [postponed to this fall](https://www.classy.org/event/sani-fashion-show-fundraiser-benefiting-unc-childrens/e270029) due to the expanding COVID-19 pandemic.

## Episode transcription

(Sarah)

*The past month has been unlike any that Carolina, that the world, has ever experienced. We know many of you have had your lives upended by the impact of the Coronavirus. We want our scholars, from the incoming class to our graduating seniors, our alumni, and everyone else in the Morehead-Cain community to know that we are here for you.*

*Despite all of the uncertainty that the pandemic has caused, we want to share some positive stories from the Foundation, starting with today’s episode featuring Niki Shamdasani, class of 2015. And now, onto the show.*

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Sarah O’Carroll. I spoke with Niki in early March about Sani and how a recent partnership with Rent the Runway will increase access to South Asian formalwear for women across the globe.*

*Niki, thanks so much for coming down to Chapel Hill to speak with me today.*

(Niki)

*Thank you for having me.*

(Sarah)

*We at the Foundation have been so excited to see all the headlines from Good Morning America, Business Insider, and ABC News, on the partnership with Rent the Runway, the fashion subscription service. I’d love to hear how that came about and what first spawned the idea to contact the company to begin with.*

(Niki)

*We’re so excited about this partnership. So we launched South-Asian Fashion on Rent the Runway, launched is the new vertical, and it all started a bit over a year ago. We had been thinking about rental platforms for Sani to be on in general because we had clientele that were non-Asian. They were coming to us when they were planning on attending South Asian events and would ask, “Is there a rental option? Because I don’t know if I’ll go to another South Asian wedding, and I’m not sure if I should buy or not.”*

*There were these people that were kind of in between. And so we had been thinking about it for a while. And we had always thought that Rent the Runway would be the perfect destination for our clothes as a go-to already for designer clothing, for occasion wear. I mean, they’ve spent so much time figuring out how to make the experience great for the customer. So we’d been thinking about them but hadn’t reached out.*

*So I was listening to the podcast, “How I Built This,” and Jennifer Hyman, the CEO of Rent the Runway, was on there. And she talked about how she had cold-emailed Diane von Furstenberg, a big designer, when she was starting Rent the Runway. And you know that that was in a lot of ways, you know, how it got her business rolling and everything. And so I was just inspired when I heard that and decided to email her and, you know, didn’t have her email, but tried a bunch of different ones until it seemed like one worked and basically pitched her the idea.*

*It’s amazing to me that someone at her level actually forwarded my email on. And from there I was in touch with her team. And, you know, it took a year for this to happen because it was a new category. So fabrics had to be tested and a lot of things had to come together. But it finally did. And we’ve been really excited about the feedback and everything.*

(Sarah)

*Now, has fashion always been a passion of yours and something that you knew you would want to get into? I know that you co-founded with your sister — so how did this decision come about to start your own company?*

(Niki)

*So fashion was never, ever on my radar. I mean, not that what you study in college necessarily determines what you’re doing, but I studied political science and business. I was excited by startups, by politics. Nothing to do with fashion. My excitement has always been around creating new things and problem solving. And so when I was in New York a little over two years ago and had just left my job at a startup accelerator, my sister was spending the summer with me and we kind of had the head space to be able to think about this problem that we personally experienced of trying to find this South Asian fashion that, you know, we could see ourselves in through an experience that worked well, and we just didn’t.*

*That was really the impetus, again, like problem solving, especially for ourselves and then going from there. And so Sani was really started to create value at the intersection of design and experience. So our designs are rooted in South Asian heritage and the culture and the craftsmanship. And then we fuse it with the perspectives of first-generation South Asian Americans. And we tie it all together through an experience that’s meant to make the cultural clothing more accessible.*

*And what I mean by accessible is that 82 percent of South Asian Americans still go abroad, like to India, to buy their cultural clothing. 82 percent. That was a mind-blowing statistic to us. And there are over eighty-thousand South Asian weddings happening in North America alone each year. So there are a lot of people that need these clothes, but they’re not finding what they want over here. And so that was really why we started to figure that out and to give people more accessibility over here.*

*So 2020 is just about taking that to the next level. We have some exciting new partnerships coming up. We have a new website and in-person experience that will actually be launching pretty soon. And so it’s all about taking the learnings and the foundation we’ve created over the past two years and taking it to the next level.*

(Sarah)

*Was there a moment when you and your sister were collaborating on this and realized, OK, this is going to work, that we have something here and we see the market for it and we’re going to go with it?*

(Niki)

*So I wouldn’t say there’s necessarily been one moment. I mean, from the very beginning, a lot of people told us, “You are entering the hardest market.” I mean fashion in general. You know, people say it’s a hard business. And then when it comes to South Asian fashion, which is this particular category where there are so many culturally-entrenched mindsets, people thought we were kind of delusional for wanting to do this. And I know that some people still think that.*

*But first for us, it was again, not one moment, but several moments when we’d hear customers say something like, “Wow, it’s so cool that I don’t have to go to India to get what I want now.” A young woman who had never been interested in South Asian clothing before was like, “I want so many of the pieces here. I can’t decide.” You know, things like that over and over this Rent the Runway partnership and getting the feedback that continues to make us feel like we’re doing the right thing.*

*And obviously there are tons of lows within that, too. But I think a lot about the difference between being persistent and stupidity, and how to tell the difference between the two. When are you just chasing after something that might not work? And I think what determines which one it is is really adapting and learning from the feedback. And so it’s not that we’ve been doing the same things over and over again in service of this mission. We’ve been continuously adapting.*

*And I think that’s what makes me feel like it’s working, as a long answer here to your short question. It’s that we continue to learn. We continue to, I think, become better based on the feedback. And we’re just gonna keep doing that until, you know, we are the go-to South Asian brand outside of India and South Asia.*

(Sarah)

*Well, it seems like you are well on your way to being that already. You mentioned some mentors that have given you feedback. And so were any of those from during your time in the Morehead-Cain program, even if it maybe didn’t click at the time, because you said fashion wasn’t super on the mind, but but later on, and seeing how those words or experiences might have affected you for where you are today.*

(Niki)

*Absolutely. It’s really about a mindset. I think what I got from Carolina and the Morehead-Cain experience is a mindset of continuing to try new things, even if you are failing at some. All of those things, right? And sometimes, it’s a mindset of just continuing to push forward, to push yourself. And, you know, there were a lot of things, a lot of internships and experiences that just wouldn’t have been possible without the Morehead-Cain.*

*But, you know, because I had the support from it, I was able to try something that I just wouldn’t have thought of before. Like when I entered Carolina, I thought, I’m going to go work in Washington, D.C. one day and I’m going to be, you know, a political aide or something like that. And that obviously shifted pretty dramatically because I was able to do an internship with Corey Ford, a Morehead-Cain alumna who ran Matter, the startup accelerator, and I was able to work with Sallie Krawcheck at Ellevate and experience all of these things which kind of, you know, would teach me, again, problem-solving, how to just tackle a really big problem and figure it out along the way.*

*And from Carolina in general, I continue to be pretty involved with the entrepreneurial community through Innovate Carolina, 1789 \[Student Venture Fund\], and my entrepreneurship, minor. And so I get to work with students. You know, I mentor some through 1789, but really I get to be around incredible people who are pushing themselves and kind of just giving all of their selves to a variety of different things. And so, I mean, that’s what I have learned and what I continue to learn from Carolina. And this program, as well, was totally at the core of what we’re doing*

(Sarah)

*We’ll be right back. We may be off UNC’s campus for now, but we can still be connected.*

(Sarah)

*Join us this Wednesday, April 1st at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time for our Alumni Speaker Series with David Gardner, class of ’88. David is the founder and “Chief Rule Breaker” for the financial services company The Motley Fool. David will offer financial and investment advice amidst this market volatility. RSVP on the MCN to access the Zoom link.*

(Sarah)

*To go back to the dresses and the formal wear itself, was there any inspiration that went into the design of them and how you wanted to convey that?*

(Niki)

*Absolutely. So one place I’ll start is that a lot of people think that all South Asian fashion is categorized by the word: “Sari.” But “sari” is only one style within South Asian fashion. So actually at the very beginning, we wanted to be really intentional about making people aware of the other styles that are there. And so we tend to do a bunch of styles that we’ve always been most comfortable in growing up and really take the inspiration from our influences over time, from, you know, trips to India that we were able to take, where you get to see the architecture, the food, the colors.*

*There’s I mean, there’s so much inspiration in India. And so we often start with a silhouette that’s maybe a little bit more traditionally Indian. And then we will pick a fabric that’s a little bit more Western or just different, right, and fuse those together. Or, we’ll take kind of a more Western silhouette and then use a more traditional fabric on on that. And so it’s all about the elements that bring together both of our identities, our South Asian identity and, you know, first-generation South Asian Americans as our identity. And so inspiration really comes from everywhere. But I’d say those are kind of the core elements*

(Sarah)

*So in talking about this whole new market available for people who may not have to travel across countries to get this, of course, there’s always conversations about appropriation. Sani doesn’t seem…Sani seems to find tradition, and making everything look authentic to the culture, that seems to be a priority. But to what extent is appropriation part of the daily conversations that you have? And what are you thinking about in terms of how the business will both make it accessible without watering down the value and the significance for so many people around the world of how these dresses should look and the kinds of experiences that they should be had in?*

(Niki)

*It’s such a good question. And to us, the difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation is knowledge and understanding of the context. So, you know, when there was that uproar over Coachella, you know, someone was wearing a bindi, the kind of colored dot that you wear on your forehead, it was because that item had completely been removed from its context. People didn’t understand what it means to married women in India, what it means to people.*

(Sarah)

*And so to us, as long as we can do a really good job of helping make sure that all people have the information — and we try to do that by describing the fabrics, describing where things are worn and things like that — then we can help make sure that it’s not appropriation. At the end of the day, we can’t completely control where or how someone else chooses to wear the clothing. But as long as we do our best of informing them, that’s all we can really do.*

(Niki)

*And to us, a good example of that was even with this Rent the Runway partnership. It wasn’t about just putting the clothes up for this completely new category. We actually made a video with Rent the Runway that came out yesterday, actually. And basically it describes here are the pieces; here’s where it’s from; here’s why we won’t say that this is “South-Asian fashion” because it’s such a rich, varied region. So all we’re doing is giving you a teaser, a taste to to learn more.*

*And we go in to show here’s how you drape it; here’s where you wear it. And so that’s another reason why Rent the Runway was really the perfect partner: they cared about that context. And that’s how we can do what you’re talking about, right, to make sure that the respect and the dignity is still given to the clothes, even as it is more globalized. And we hope one day worn from South Asian weddings to galas and everything in between.*

(Sarah)

*Whenever we have an alumni here at the Foundation for our Alumni Speaker Series or other types of events, scholars are always so eager to say, “OK, what can I learn from you and how do I, not replicate, but be able to implement all of this great advice into my own career plans?” Especially for those who may be looking very soon at their next steps post-graduation from Carolina. So is there anything that you would want to impart for those who have a business administration or interest in startups, perhaps that kind of caree focus? What might you encourage them to do? Is it to be persistent when things don’t always go your way or is it about resilience and the difference between resilience and stupidity, as you mentioned, or any other types of takeaways?*

(Niki)

*Yeah. So first of all, when starting a business, it feels like I always have to ask other people for things and I’m asking favors. So whenever I can do anything to help, I say yes as much as possible. So if there’s ever anything I can do, I hope anyone will reach out to me.*

*Second of all, for the actual advice, a lesson that has really sunk in relatively recently was that, if it’s meant to be, it doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy. When we were having issues with the business, whether in production or marketing or anything in between, I used to take it really personally. And really, at the end of the day, you know, I need to be better to to make sure mistakes don’t happen. But at some point, you have to understand that what’s inherent in business is that there’s going to be challenges. It’s not that if you’re doing it right, suddenly it’s going to be smooth sailing.*

*And what really made that stand out to me was, so, the Rent the Runway order was coming. It was finally done. And we were just waiting for it to arrive to be able to forward it on and FedEx lost our packages. And so my sister and I had to go to the distribution center, beg them to look through some trailers to be able to find it because we needed to send it out.*

*It finally happened that it came together but when that happened, I was like, “Why us? What should I have done differently? Just, why is this happening?” And I got on the phone with my cousin, who’s been running his own business actually in uniforms for the past ten years. And coincidentally (this might say something about FedEx; no offense to them), his packages had been lost by FedEx the week before and he had to go to the distribution center to pick it up.*

*It was this crazy coincidence where the same thing had happened to him. And he was like, “Yeah, you know, sometimes this stuff happens.” And it just made me realize that this is never going to stop. The problems are only going to get bigger, the challenges, I should say. And that’s just business. It doesn’t mean that, you know, as soon as you find the perfect product market fit or anything else, then you’re good to go.*

*For the rest of the time, it’s about continuing to tackle those and have a solution-oriented mindset instead of a complaining-oriented mindset. So that’s the advice I would give.*

(Sarah)

*Niki, thank you so much for coming here. And I wish you and Ritika, your sister, all the best in the year and in the years ahead.*

(Niki)

*Thank you so much. We couldn’t do it without your support, so we appreciate everything the Morehead-Cain Foundation has done.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you for listening to Catalyze. I’m your host, Sarah O’Carroll, and that was Niki Shamdasani, class of 2015. The Sani Fashion Show, a fundraiser for UNC Children’s Hospital has been postponed to this fall due to the coronavirus.*

*In the meantime, you can find out more about the company on their website at Sani Designs dot com or you can find them on Instagram at Sani. And of course, you can find them on Rent the Runway.*

*The music for the show is by scholar Scott Hallyburton ’22 with the band South of the Soul. You can let us know what you thought of the episode or who you think should be featured next by finding us on Twitter or Instagram at Morehead-Cain or you can send us an email at communications@morehead-cain.org. Until next time, Morehead-Cains, stay safe.*

# Cate Miller ’25: ‘No matter how niche my aspirations may be, there is a mentor out there who can assure you of what is possible’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program pair Kate Stotesbery ’17 and Cate Miller ’25 in Washington, D.C.

Written by Cate Miller ’25 of the Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team

[The Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/topics/17692/page/overview) forges connections across generations. For me, I discovered the joy of true kinship in the Washington, D.C. area.

A place of effervescent personalities, and constantly revolving ideas, there is always someone new to meet or a new location to see. As I have paved my own path in the city, the relationships Morehead-Cain has given me are irreplaceable.

My mentor is Kate Stotesbery ’17, the deputy chief of staff and communications director for the U.S. House of Representatives. We have shared ambitions, such as working in the think tank landscape at the intersection of communications, media, and politics.

I’ve begun bouncing off ambitious career ideas with friends and family, but it’s been great having a mentor who is a Morehead-Cain and UNC–Chapel Hill alumna, and who has experience living in a big city post-graduation. She has so much wisdom to share.

Our first conversation was exciting and natural. We basked in our overlapping interests, and there was a strong desire on both sides to pour into each other. We expressed a genuine curiosity in pursuing what fulfills us as individuals.

When questions pop up about my future or current policy areas of interest, Kate and I have space to explore them. Each month, we meet up to talk through each one. I usually leave with more questions than I arrived with, typically ones directed at where I see myself after completing my time at Carolina.

We also spend a lot of time laughing and exchanging stories from studying abroad, our travels, and summer adventures. We talk about how all of these weave into the fabric of our identities. Our conversations affirm for me that every person has a unique perspective to offer.

Kate gives me a valuable outlook on the near future, reassuring me that everything will fall into place. I would encourage all my fellow scholars to join the mentoring program. Our alumni have so many valuable experiences to share, and participating in the program has strengthened my affinity for the wider Morehead-Cain community.

Morehead-Cain staff thoughtfully matches every mentoring pair through shared interests. I get a sense of peace knowing that no matter how niche my aspirational career trajectory may be, there are alumni out there who can assure you that it is possible. For me, that’s Kate.

The most important lesson I’ve taken away from my mentor is that my goals are feasible and that I should be excited about what the future holds.

As I have explored D.C., I’ve reached out to fellow mentoring pairs in the area, learning about their experiences throughout mentorship. I hope you’ll follow along as I share about the two I spoke with. First up, [David von Storch ’80 and Hunter Vaughan ’24](index-113.html).

# The Catalyze podcast: Bruce Gellin ’77 on the race for a coronavirus vaccine and the defense against COVID-19’s return
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Bruce Gellin ’77 is president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington, D.C.

Morehead-Cain called Bruce Gellin ’77, president of global immunization at the [Sabin Vaccine Institute](https://www.sabin.org/) in Washington, D.C., to get a better understanding of what would need to take place before a coronavirus vaccine could protect against the next global outbreak.

We also asked scholars to share their coping strategies amidst the pandemic (thanks to Nina, Drew, Lauren, Cameron, Lizzie, Michael, Cho, Grayson, and Luke for sharing their creative ideas). You’ll hear their responses at the end of the episode. The music for this episode is by scholar Scott Hallyburton ’22, guitarist of the band South of the Soul.

## Episode transcription

(Sarah)

*Bruce, thanks for being willing to speak with me.*

(Bruce)

*It’s good to speak with you. Thanks.*

(Sarah)

*So we know it’s only been about three months since the coronavirus began to spread, yet we’re already seeing a host of pharmaceutical companies announce the beginning of trials for a vaccine. From what you’ve been able to learn about the ideas in the mix, do any of them seem promising or are there still too many unknowns at this point to reckon with first?*

(Bruce)

*I mean, I think that it’s too soon to tell. This is a new virus. And I think the important part to know about this is not only do we not understand everything about this virus, we also don’t understand immunity to this virus. For influenza, we’ve got it pretty well understood. But these coronaviruses are not influenza viruses. And if we’re going to understand how we’re going to protect people, we need to understand what kind of immunity is going to be protective.*

*We know that for some diseases, like measles, you have lifelong protection once you get measles. We don’t yet even know whether or not people who have have suffered a coronavirus infection are immune or for how long they’ll be immune. It’s our assumption that they are, every virus works that way. People who are infected then have some protection. But we don’t know how long it lasts.*

*We need to look at the level of immunity from natural infections and what the duration of immunity is. It may last a lifetime. It may last a short time. We’ll need to understand that as part of the vaccine development process. And I think as we look at these, we know that a number of these ideas aren’t going to get very far in the development process, but that’s what the development process is about. And while people talk about how long it might take — Dr. Fauci, he’s been out there saying it’s going to take a year or a year and a half — part of that is to be able to test it at various stages to make sure that what you are developing is what you wanted to develop and offered in the process of vaccine development. Things wash out because they don’t work or they don’t look like they’re safe. You can’t manufacturer them at scale. So those are all the things that are going to happen going forward.*

*Not everything is going to work its way to the finish line, which is the way it has to go, which is why it’s encouraging that there are so many ideas out there. But my guess is that, you know, there may be several different types of vaccines that come out at the end of this that will be available. And then we’ll have to make sure that there’s enough capacity globally to get them to the people who need them. There’s a large discussion about the need for global equity. We know that’s going to be a huge issue because there’s going to be much more demand than there is supply.*

(Sarah)

*And of course, the manufacturing process seems to be one of the most challenging aspects at play here. Can you share some of the obstacles that affect our prospects of mass producing a coronavirus vaccine such that anyone might be able to receive one, one day?*

(Bruce)

*Among them is we don’t know which of these vaccine approaches is going to work. And in developing a vaccine and in producing a vaccine, the production technology is pretty specific to that approach. I often tell people that it’s not like a bakery, where one day you can make cookies and the next day you can make muffins. If you’re going to develop a vaccine, the equipment to do that is specialized to the type of vaccine that you’re making. We know that flu vaccines are made in eggs, so there’s a whole system for developing vaccines in eggs. It’s unlikely that the coronavirus is going to work in that system*.

*There are a number of other ideas out there that are referred to as platform technologies and many of them are relatively new and they’re not at full scale. So the question is trying to think which vaccines might be the most promising, and starting now to think through where in the United States, and where globally, might need to be able to make these vaccines? Or do we have to start developing new facilities so that when the vaccine is proven to be the right one, we can start making it?*

*And “flattening the curve” means two things. As everybody is seeing, flattening the curve is to keep people out of the way of the virus, which then keeps people from being infected and clogging the health care system. The second part of flattening the curve is, until when? Until there’s enough immunity in the population that the virus can’t really travel that much, and can’t transmit between people because most of the population are immune.*

*And there’s two ways to get there: to recover from an infection, assuming the immunity you get is protective, and to be vaccinated. And that’s why there’s such a race of time for the vaccine, and that’s why scale is so important, because while we’re focusing on the time to get the first available vaccine, we also need to think of how long it’s going to be to get everybody vaccinated who either needs to be or wants to be. And that’s where the scale of manufacturing is so important.*

(Sarah)

*So you’ve alluded to this already, but there are a lot of equity implications that emerge from all of this. We’ve seen a sort of war room mentality nationally with respect to accelerating the development of a vaccine, but when it comes down to implementation, what are your thoughts in terms of how governments might mitigate inequality, or at least not exacerbate it, in thinking of coronavirus prevention and treatment in the future?*

(Bruce)

*Well, you know, that’s at a couple of levels. I think every country is going to have to decide that on their own. So, for example, when we thought about pandemic preparedness, we often thought about the kinds of groups who should be considered to get the vaccine when it’s first available. And obviously, you can’t really predict that ahead of time. You need to understand how the problem, in this case, the coronavirus pandemic, is unfolding because you’ll need to match that program with what the needs are.*

*But for example, when we did this with pandemic influenza, we thought about, for the United States, about small groups of people that should be considered early when a vaccine is available, such as people who are involved in homeland and national security. As you see now with the health care community, those are who are on the front lines, because we need to keep the health care system going. And similarly, those who do community support services.*

*There are others that are involved in keeping society going, which we refer to as the “critical infrastructure.” For example, emergency services, public safety personnel, fire fighters, the people who do communications and electricity, nuclear gas, water, sewage. So there’s an understanding of the people in the country who keep the critical infrastructure going. And we need to make sure that they are protected. They can go to work and keep that going as well. And then within the general population, are there some groups at higher risk than others?*

*So that’s a broad sweep of this, but that’s only to say that this is a way we thought about this for pandemic influenza. We have to rethink about what this means for the current situation. And every country would have to be thinking about this on their own because no country is going to have enough the first day that vaccines are available and need to be thinking that one through. But in parallel is the larger question about global equity. That’s the discussion that we have in the United States for the supply that we have.*

*Similarly, we need to be thinking about what this means for people around the world and how there’s going to be not just capacity, but a distribution system that allows allows fair distribution and equity for every country. Knowing that in each country, nobody’s going to have enough. And each country is going to have to define who their priority populations are as well. It’s not too early to start thinking about that because these are complicated conversations that are worth at least beginning to float now so that people can have them. So when vaccines are available, they have some understanding of how they got there.*

(Sarah)

*There’s a whole host of factors that biotech companies are having to take into consideration as they think about the possibility of a vaccine such as age, or respiratory illnesses, I’m sure there are many others. Can you walk us through some of those considerations?*

(Bruce)

*Well, I think that the definition of a pandemic is when there is a virus that is new and nobody has any immunity and it transmits between people, which is why we’re where we are. I think there’s recognition that nobody on the planet has any immunity to this right now, and therefore everyone would benefit from a vaccine. That said, as you think about different types of vaccines, not all could be available. Not all would be appropriate for everybody.*

*So, for example, people who have compromised immune systems probably shouldn’t get a vaccine that’s got a live or weakened form of the virus in it. There’s also been a discussion about, you know, what kind of vaccines would be safe for pregnant women. That’s only to say that those are considerations down the road. We first have to make sure we have a vaccine that can work and is safe for the general population, and then we can see if there are a number of different vaccines, which ones might be more appropriate for some of those vaccines, but for some of those vaccines more than others.*

(Sarah)

*So the Sabin Vaccine Institute is aggressively involved in developing a universal influenza vaccine. How has COVID-19 affected this focus, or has it perhaps expanded or respond to other efforts at the institute?*

(Bruce)

*The Sabin Vaccine Institute focuses on vaccines and vaccination, so it’s not surprising that this is something that’s been interesting for us, as you said. We had a project for a couple of years focusing on influenza because influenza remains, despite the fact that everybody is focused on the coronavirus, a huge threat for the same reasons as the pandemic. And because the influenza virus mutates quite rapidly and we know that it’s only a matter of time until it can turn into another virus that has similar qualities for which there is no immunity in the population. And we’ll have a similar effect.*

*So we haven’t changed our efforts on the development of a universal influenza vaccine because we recognize that that’s another vaccine that we’re going to need. The reason the universal vaccine is so important, and we refer to it that way, is because influenza viruses mutate so readily. That’s why we have to get a new vaccine every year to tailor make the vaccine for the season to match the viruses out there.*

*And the hope is that we can develop a vaccine that will not only handle seasonal flu, so we don’t have to adjust the vaccine for year-to-year variation but it can also be protective against the viruses no one has seen yet. The virus emerges because of some mutation or some recombination with an animal influenza virus that creates a new virus, which could have pandemic potential. So we’ve been pushing hard on that one, not only to think about whether the basic science is needed to create a universal vaccine, but trying to think of transformative ideas. Are there other things we should be thinking about that we haven’t yet? Should we look at this problem in a new way?*

*I think we were encouraged when, two years, ago Bill Gates went out there and had this grand challenge for a universal influenza vaccine. And it was really the theme that we’ve been pushing. We know how to work on our seasonal flu vaccines. We need new perspectives. We need new science. We need new scientists because we need to look at this problem from every possible angle to see if there’s something else we should be doing that we haven’t.*

(Sarah)

*Well, despite how fraught these terms are, it’s still relieving to hear from an expert to provide some context for the outbreak. Is there anything you’d like to add?*

(Bruce)

*Well, I think, you know, we’re going to be watching this process very carefully. There are a whole raft of ideas for therapies out there as well. We’ve heard about a couple. We’ve heard about some AIDS drugs that might be tried. We’ve heard about malaria drugs that might be tried. I know that the pharmaceutical companies have lots of molecules that they’ve developed for all kinds of reasons. And there’s a screening process going on now to see if anything that they have in their freezers might work against this.*

*So I’m encouraged that there’s so much attention there that something will come out of that relatively soon. And frankly, because there’s so much disease, it makes it relatively easy, if you can say it that way, to evaluate this. Because when there’s not much disease, when you have a real problem, then you have a hard time accumulating enough evidence here. We’ve got lots of people who can provide lots of evidence and the experience of what some of these products may do.*

*But switching back to the vaccine piece, I think the other thing to keep in mind is that it is about setting expectations. We know that in the process of developing, there are often bumps in the road. There are things about developing this vaccine that, maybe things will go shorter, maybe things will go longer. But one thing for sure is that not all these hundred ideas, and I don’t even know half of them, but not all of these hundred ideas are going to make it to the finish line.*

(Sarah)

*This is no extraordinary epiphany but lately, I’ve been thinking of just how many unforeseen consequences the coronavirus pandemic has caused. The economic fallout was perhaps more predictable, but things like not being able to see a relative in a nursing home due to physical distancing guidelines, these are things that I don’t think a lot of us have ever experienced before or that we really saw coming.*

(Bruce)

*Yeah, I mean, that’s what struck me when I got into this fifteen years ago, was realizing that what starts as a health problem escalates into a full global, socioeconomic problem. And that’s what you’re seeing everyday in some aspects of the news cycle of how this is tapping into that. And you need to pay attention to all of it. But that’s why, you know, if you don’t solve the health problem, you’re not going to solve the latter.*

*I think the challenge is how to how to handle both of those simultaneously. But I’m encouraged at least by what I’ve seen on the health side for both promising therapies and vaccines. They’ll never been here as fast as people want them but it seems that there’s enough investment, enough attention, enough coordination that will we’ll have what we need before long.*

(Sarah)

*Well, Bruce, thank you so much, I really appreciate it.*

(Bruce)

*Sure. Thanks for having me.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you for listening to Catalyze. I’m your host, Sarah O’Carroll, and that was Bruce Gellin of the Sabin Vaccine Institute. You can let us know what you thought of the episode or who you think should be featured next by finding us on Twitter or Instagram at Morehead-Cain or you can send us an email at communications@moreheadcain.org. Finally, to close out the show, we asked scholars to share with us their coping strategies amidst this pandemic. We got a lot of creative responses. Here’s what they said.*

(Nina Fisher ’24)

*Hi, everyone. My name is Nina, and I am recording from Ontario, Canada. I’ve been keeping busy during quarantine by practicing my handstands because I was always told that they need to last at least eight seconds, and I’m not there yet.*

(Drew McRacken ’21)

*Hey there, Morehead-Cain quarantine crew. This is Drew McRacken ’21, checking in with some of my favorite coping techniques thus far. I’ve been trying to pick up knitting, hacky sack, and playing the guitar. And, I also impulsively shave my beard. So, cheers.*

(Lauren Gornto)

*Hi, my name is Lauren Gornto. And my fun story from Quarantine is last week, my housemate Lizzie and I ordered some plain white ukuleles from Amazon and we painted them and now we have these cute little ukuleles to play and write songs with.*

(Cameron Champion ’20)

*One way I’ve been able to stick to routine better while living and taking classes at home is having a big whiteboard that tracks my sleep. My running and other exercise.*

(Lizzie Russler)

*Hi, my name is Lizzie and I am calling from Charleston, South Carolina. I’m one of the ways that I’m coping with these times of uncertainty has been to scrapbook my own yearbook.*

(Michael Alcorn ’23)

*Everybody, this is Michael Alcorn from the Class of 2023 calling in from Waxhaw, North Carolina. I hope everyone is happy and healthy. And some ways I’ve been coping with COVID-19 is by picking up new hobbies like skateboarding, yoga, and video games.*

(Cho Nikoi ’23)

*A fun way I figured out to make mundane activities more fun is to just film myself doing them. Whenever I make eggs in the morning, I film it and talk while I do it, and it just makes mundanity much more bearable.*

(Grayson Sword ’23)

*Hi, this is Grayson Sword, ’23, calling in from Asheville, North Carolina. I’m getting through quarantine by trying my hand in new recipes with my family. Up next, homemade banana bread and sourdough from scratch.*

(Luke Buxton ’21)

*My name is Luke Buxton and I’m a junior scholar at UNC. Outside of my classes and extracurriculars, I’ve been learning how to DJ to pass some stime, trying to learn about transitions, matching beats per minute filters, hot cues, loops. So I don’t know, maybe if the Morehead-Cain Foundation wants to move in the direction of EDM for the fall banquet. . . . Just saying, I could be your guy.*

# Alumni reflections from the Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South with historian Taylor Branch ’68
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Participants on the 2024 Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South outside Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.

In April, a group of around thirty alumni and their guests went on a civil rights bus tour of the South as part of Morehead-Cain’s [Alumni Journeys](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/page/alumni-travel) initiative launched last fall.

For the first part of the trip, civil rights historian Taylor Branch ’68 accompanied the group throughout Montgomery, Alabama. The alumnus is known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning trilogy chronicling the life of Martin Luther King Jr., [America in the King Years](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-King-Years/Taylor-Branch/9781451662467).

The alumni visited Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, pastored by King and the launching point for the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, the Freedom Rides Museum, and three sites established by the [Equal Justice Initiative](https://eji.org/) (founded and led by renowned attorney and social justice activist Bryan Stevenson): the Legacy Museum, National Memorial for Peace and Justice, and the newly opened Freedom Monument Sculpture Park.

For Benjeil Edghill ’98, walking in King’s footsteps reinforced for him that achieving civil rights is “an ongoing battle” in the United States.

“We must never give up on our pursuit of a more just and equitable America, because injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” he said.

On the second day, alumni traveled to Birmingham, Alabama, to walk through the Kelly Ingram park and hear from Carolyn Maull McKinstry, an eyewitness to the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963 and a lifelong civil rights activist who marched under King.

Dave Brunson ’64 reflected that although he was in his twenties during the height of the civil rights movement, the trip brought him closer to the lived experiences of Black Americans who were fighting for justice at the time.

“To listen to those who experienced the church bombings, the loss of their house to the building of an interstate . . . everything felt very personal,” the alumnus said.

For the final day of the tour, the group visited the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel, the site of King’s assassination, in Memphis, Tennessee. Members of Hattiloo Theatre, one of the country’s few all-Black repertory theaters, performed an original work for the group at the museum.

After lunch at the historic Four Way Restaurant, alumni went on a driving tour of the city, including stops at the I AM A MAN Plaza (adjacent to the Clayborn Temple), the gathering place for the 1968 sanitation workers’ strike, and the Slave Haven Underground Railroad Museum. The afternoon came to an end with a tour of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music.

For Steve Toben ’78, the experience facilitated “potential for powerful action across generations” of scholars.

“I cannot begin to express how meaningful the connections enabled by these trips are among alumni, staff, and current scholars,” he said.

The Foundation is grateful to Barbara Rosser Hyde ’83 and Pitt Hyde for hosting the group at their home in Memphis to conclude the trip, as well as for facilitating the tour and private performance at the National Civil Rights Museum.

The next trip will be to London from September 22 to 29, 2024 to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the British Morehead-Cain Program. [Learn more about group travel through Morehead-Cain Alumni Journeys](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/page/alumni-travel).

By making these connections to history, I hope this will prepare me to be a more caring and compassionate physician, prepared to treat individuals of all backgrounds.” —Shivam Bhargava ’22, program manager at Asian Health Coalition in Chicago and a Global Health Corps U.S. Fellow

# Morehead-Cain Mentor Andrea Stumpf ’84 on taking an ‘exploratory approach’ to mentorship
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Andrea Stumpf ’84

Written by Cate Miller ’25, Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team

For Andrea Stumpf ’84, serving as a Morehead-Cain Mentor was a perfect way to “make a difference” as an alumna.

During their first conversation, Andrea was surprised at how much she and her mentee, Ann Goulian ’25, had to talk about. (The Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program pairs scholars with alumni based on shared values and interests.)

“Our meeting was informal but quite wonderful, with a fluidity to the conversation,” she said. “We were able to quickly enter our comfort zones, naturally gravitating towards discussion surrounding women in the working world.”

The experience of being a mentor has affirmed for Andrea that there may indeed be some words of wisdom she has to offer as an experienced professional, she said.

“It’s very validating for the person you’re helping, but it’s also extremely validating for yourself, to draw from your past and make something useful out of it for someone else,” said Andrea, principal at [Structured Partnerships](https://www.structuredpartnerships.com/) in Kensington, Maryland. “It’s a simple and discreet way to help.”

Throughout their meetings, she’s encouraged Ann to pursue opportunities that are different from the ones the scholar has done in college and through the Summer Enrichment Program.

“As you expand your experiences, your ability to see the bigger picture increases more and more,” the alumna said. Before founding her own partnership advising firm, she worked in government, law firms, private companies, and a multilateral development institution.

Andrea said mentoring conversations are often open-ended, allowing her mentee the freedom to choose the focus.

“We take an exploratory approach to our meetings, where I’m in reactive mode to what Ann is thinking about, and she sets the stage for me to help her in the best way possible,” she said. “When you make the transition to the post-grad world, you see more of what the world is about, and it’s important to take an exploratory approach there, too.”

This is the third and final edition of [my series](index-121.html) about Morehead-Cain Mentors based in Washington, D.C. For the [second piece](index-113.html), I spoke with David von Storch ’80.

# Morehead-Cain Mentor David von Storch ’80: ‘Experiencing failure frees you up to succeed’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

David von Storch ’80

Written by Cate Miller ’25, Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team

When Morehead-Cain asked David von Storch ’80 to serve as a mentor, he gave an immediate and enthusiastic “yes.” David had never participated in a mentoring program and didn’t quite know what to expect, but he wanted to “contribute to the next generation of scholars,” he said.

“Mentoring became a meaningful way for me to give back to the Foundation, which has given me so many opportunities and connections I wouldn’t have had otherwise,” David said. The alumnus is the CEO and founder of [Urban Adventures Companies, Inc.,](https://uacompanies.com/) in Washington, D.C.

The Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program paired David with Hunter Vaughan ’24, a double major in business administration and public policy at Carolina. The scholar said he was interested in signing up to gain wisdom and advice for what comes next after college.

“It’s been great to hear about David’s career journey, the topics he’s passionate about, and connect lessons from his entrepreneurial journey,” said Hunter, an incoming business analyst at McKinsey & Company in D.C. Outside of planning for post-graduation, the two have talked about graduate school, fitness, and ways to optimize the last few months on campus.

“I’m also interested in what it takes to start a business, and he has deep experience in that area,” Hunter said.

The pair have discussed ideas behind successful ventures and the logistics of building a startup. Other common themes have been preparing for pivots and failure, according to David.

“I’ve told Hunter that if you can get your hands around what failure looks like during your endeavors, you’ll be okay because experiencing failure frees you up to succeed,” the mentor said.

David has encouraged Hunter to be comfortable with not knowing what his career trajectory will look like, and to prioritize fostering a “trustworthy support system” of people you can rely on.

“It’s normal to not know your passion, calling, or your ‘why’ when you’re twenty-one years old. For me, it took until my mid-forties to look around and feel like this is where I belong professionally,” the entrepreneur said.

He said pouring into a scholar has been an affirming experience, particularly given the shared affinities for the Program and University.

“For alumni considering mentoring: you should realize that you’re a part of a very special group of people, you have skills and experience to share, and there’s value in all of that,” he said. “Why not embrace and share that with the next generation?”

# Anna Connors ’24, Aayas Joshi ’26 awarded Rich Beckman Documentary Award to document effects of climate change in Arctic Circle
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Anna Connors ’24 and Aayas Joshi ’26 have received the [2023 Rich Beckman Documentary Award](http://hussman.unc.edu/rich-beckman-documentary-award) from the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media.

The award goes to a journalism student or students to “conduct fieldwork for documentary storytelling or interactive multimedia projects,” according to the school.

Anna and Aayas are teaming up to research and document the effects of the climate crisis on indigenous communities near the Arctic Circle. The scholars will be based in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, for several weeks in December 2023.

The project will expand upon Anna’s previous research on how climate change is impacting ecosystems, and Aayas’s research from his [Morehead-Cain International Gap Year](https://www.moreheadcain.org/scholar-experience/international-gap-year/) on the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities in the Himalayas.

[Aayas shared about his gap year on Morehead-Cain’s Catalyze podcast](https://www.moreheadcain.org/2022/12/the-travel-episode-stories-from-the-morehead-cain-international-gap-year-with-aayas-joshi-26-olu-kopano-26-and-scholar-host-elias-guedira-26/#:~:text=For%20our%20listeners%2C%20Aayas%20and,World%20College%20in%20Changshu%2C%20China.).

.

Anna’s connection to Churchhill began in 2015 through the International Student-led Arctic Monitoring and Research program. The scholar researched in the Wapusk National Park south of Churchill to better understand how a warming planet affects permafrost, polar bears, and soil microbial communities in the area.

Anna left the experience “feeling like Churchill had a unique story,” she said.

“The media has focused on the region’s tourism—its polar bears and northern lights—but there is so much to learn from the community of people who call Churchill home,” Anna said. “As a media and journalism student, I see the immense potential in Churchill that’s been overlooked by most journalistic projects in the region.”

The scholars will be in Canada during the off season of tourism—a strategic choice to focus on nontourism sectors, according to Aayas.

“We want to tell Churchill’s story in a way that puts its people at the center,” said Aayas, a media and journalism major at Carolina and a photographer on the Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team. “We have a lot to learn before we leave this winter.”

## Episode Transcription

(Aayas)

*It’s 1:24 a.m., and I am standing outside my tent on the world’s highest glacier. On Everest, you only get one weather window a year to attempt to climb, and I was just told it opened up an hour ago.*

*In front of me on the icefall, I see tiny specks of light moving up. Originating from all corners of the planet, after years of preparation, these specs emanate from the headlamps of the most determined people in the world.*

*Earlier this evening, I met climbers fundraising for disability awareness, for victims of war, advocates bridging racial gaps in mountaineering, climate scientists, documentary teams, and those pushing the known limits of the human body.*

*Base camp is a congregation of the most inspiring people and the most fascinating stories. It’s no wonder I’ve been standing here absolutely mesmerized. I’m in disbelief of where I am, atop a shifting glacier, standing taller than entire continents, next to a lake of clouds shrouding the valley below us, and surrounded by towering peaks glistening next to a rising moon.*

*Just me, my camera, and the captivating stillness of a night in the Himalayas.*

(Olu)

*Two vans to my left. They pull off. Seven lions in front of me. Click, click, click. One hundred photos, 30 minutes, one place. The first lion goes down, the second goes down, the third goes down, and the fourth follows. Edwin says, “A hunt is about to occur.” We take off, the wind brushing our face. The binoculars out. We’re following. Turn left. 1.5 kilometers later, we reach the spot. Boom. The lioness strikes a baby buffalo under the brush. The three lionesses follow. They arrive at the scene. Everyone in the van shocked. The male lion approaches the scene, takes the baby buffalo. The lioness is pushed against our van. We’re all frozen. Click, click, click.*

(Elias)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Elias Guedira, from the class of 2026. Joining us today are Aayas Joshi and Olu Kopano from the class of 2026. The two scholars went on an international gap year through Morehead-Cain. Aayas and Olu share their discoveries and reflections from their time abroad, as well as advice for incoming scholars.*

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining the podcast today.*

(Aayas)

*Thank you.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us on here.*

(Elias)

*For our listeners, Aayas and Olu are both wrapping up their first semester at UNC after taking a gap year through Morehead-Cain’s International Gap Year program. Olu graduated from St. Paul’s School in Baltimore, Maryland, while Aayas graduated from United World College in Changshu, China. Fun fact about Aayas, he is actually the first Morehead-Cain scholar from Nepal. Olu and Aayas, I hope you’ve had a smooth time adapting to life back here in the classroom, but also sufficient time to reflect on your gap year experiences. How does it feel to be back in a traditional learning environment?*

(Olu)

*It feels good. I had a magnificent year, probably the year where I was able to have the most and do the most learning that I’ve done in my life. But near the end of it, I was ready to be back in the school setting. And that school setting looks different now than what it would have pre-gap year. Pre-gap year, I was thinking business, minor in Japanese, and neither of those are in the equation now. Global studies, most likely, and pursuing Spanish, and it’s exactly what I want. I’m taking classes I’m passionate about and have found a direction that I like.*

(Elias)

*Nice.*

(Aayas)

*For me, coming back to conventional education, traditional education, has been interesting. I feel like my gap year prepared me for leaving home and the subtle chaos that is the first semester of college, but also because my gap year helped me decide what path I wanted to take for college, similar to what Olu was saying. And so what I’m studying now feels a little more intentional because I can connect it with what I learned on my gap year.*

(Elias)

*It’s so incredible being able to gain that experience, especially before going into college, really getting to explore the world outside of it before delving into it. So, thank you again for being on the podcast. So, flashback to March 2021. You’re looking at your computer or phone, or mobile device, and you learn that you’ve just received the Morehead-Cain scholarship. What prompts you to say, “Hey, I’m going to press a pause button on my college education and take a gap year for now?”*

(Olu)

*It was the idea that I have loved travel. I was able to travel to Tokyo in high school, had such a memorable experience, and I was missing that feeling. I had opportunities to travel later in high school, but COVID-19 hit, and that ended all possibility of that. So thinking of going into another year of schooling and missing out on the travel that I potentially could have had, just like I’d missed out in the past, was just an opportunity that I felt like I couldn’t miss again, especially when Morehead was funding a significant part of it.*

(Aayas)

*For me, I went to an international school, and so what happened was after they initially sent us back home for COVID, they weren’t able to bring us back. And so, I had gone through one and a half years of online school and was feeling pretty burned out by that point. And I’ve also always believed that the way that the system works right now tends to rush kids into choosing their life’s path of like 17, 18 years old when they haven’t really had a chance to explore what they really want to do. And so, I really liked the idea of taking a pause and exploring my interests in trying to find out what I want to pursue for college.*

*And I think what ended up prompting me to actually take the gap year was, ironically, the Catalyze podcast. I remember, I was listening to the gap year episode before this one, and it was Taylor’s voice—Taylor Shinal, class of ’25—and she was talking about her experience in the Serengeti, watching The Great Migration. And I remember listening to that at home and, like, pacing around my room saying, “I need to do this. This is exciting.”*

(Olu)

*Now that you mentioned that, it was honestly, I can vividly remember the time when I heard the Catalyze podcast on the gap year. And I went, I was sitting on the couch with my dad, and we were listening to it, and we both gave each other the same look and said, “You’re going to do this, you’re going to take this gap year.” And here I am.*

(Elias)

*Yeah, this is a full two years later. It’s such an incredible feeling. I mean, I was also in that same position, having taken a gap year myself, and I remember listening to this podcast and thinking, “Wow, what they did was super cool.” And the fact that we all get to be on the other side of it is such a treat. So a lot of people ended up taking gap years during COVID. Did you have any concerns that this was the wrong path initially? And what would you have to say to anybody that’s taking a gap year right now and might feel a little bit lost?*

(Olu)

*I don’t know if I had any concerns that it was the wrong path, but it is not just one path. It is an experience that is up to you to decide. And that’s scary. That is something that people don’t like. That’s something at one point that I was scared of. I had done all this research, and it led to nothing. And I thought, “What is this gap year going to be? What am I going to do? I have no clue what it’s going to look like.”*

*I was getting frustrated with myself. It was a difficult period, but it was ultimately one of the most rewarding periods of my life because I was, for the first time, had the power to decide what I was going to do with my life for a complete year.*

*So for people in this position now and struggling with what they might potentially do for the second half of the gap year, or if they’re thinking about it in the future, I would say lean into that discomfort because the other side will be better.*

(Elias)

*So if you were to condense your gap year travels into a storybook with chapters, what would you entitle each of those chapters, and what would the setting have been for each of them?*

(Olu)

*That’s a really good question. So I think this kind of goes off my last answer, and the first part was about diving in. So I would label the first chapter, which was Costa Rica, “Diving.” And that was diving into a language that I was unfamiliar with, diving into a culture and area that I was unfamiliar with, and diving into a project, which was construction, and building homes for single mothers, which obviously I had not done construction before. So everything was new. Everything was diving full force into it. And that was probably the first chapter.*

*And the second chapter would be “Solo.” Solo was in Saint Lucia. It was just me there. I was working an internship, and I didn’t know anybody. I had one family member, but other than that, that was it. And my nights were spent by myself. Most of my days were spent by myself. And that period was so important to the growth that I was able to develop later.*

*And the third chapter would be “Homecoming.” Homecoming because I was in Africa in that period. I traveled to Tanzania, Egypt, and Morocco. And even though I’d never been to Africa, my family, me, all of us included, we’ve always felt connected to Africa in some sense or another. And being able to actually step foot on the motherland was really important to me. And really, it felt like I was at home.*

*And I guess the last chapter would just be maybe “Jump Around.” I was in Europe, and I went to seven different countries. I stayed in Spain for six weeks, and then the other six were five days here, five days there. And each chapter was very pivotal in the gap year.*

(Aayas)

*My chapters would be slightly different. I think the first chapter I would call, “Hey, why don’t we go to Everest?” Fun little hike. So I had lived in Nepal for 18, 19 years, and I had never seen Mount Everest. So I told a group of friends, “Why don’t we go hiking and go see it?” And so that was the first chapter.*

*The second chapter I would call, “Oops, I accidentally hitchhiked the entire South Asian coast” because that was not the intention when I left home. I left on a fairly spontaneous international flight to New Delhi, and I happened to travel for almost two months, over 8,000 miles, 26 cities, around the entire South Asian coastline. So that was really fun.*

*Chapter three would probably be “Returned to Everest for a cause.” So that’s when I started to work on climate change projects in the region.*

*And the fourth project would be, I’d probably call it “The heritage project.” So for context, in 2015, Nepal faced a mega earthquake that flattened half of my city. And so a big debate that was sparked after that was, how do we preserve and document heritage so that we don’t lose it again? And I worked with a professor at UNC actually, a religious studies professor at UNC, on documenting tangible and intangible heritage 3D models, things like that. So that was a really cool project that I worked on, but those would be my four chapters.*

(Elias)

*So when you say documenting tangible and intangible artifacts, what exactly do you mean by that?*

(Aayas)

*It was really cool, actually. We had a team of people, and we would fly LiDAR drones around heritage sites to then 3D model them later. And the goal was to be able to create a virtual space where you can access this heritage and also have annotated stories and pictures and ways to explore the area without actually being there, so that if another earthquake does come and destroys the heritage, there’s still a replica or a version of it that we can still visit later.*

(Elias)

*Aayas, for viewers that are unfamiliar with your line of work, you spend a lot of time documenting monuments, documenting stories through photography, storytelling, and blogging. In fact, you’re working on a project with the goal of helping integrate Himalayan communities into scientific research and documenting the effects of global warming on these communities to spread awareness. Can you talk a little bit more about how you got involved with this project during your gap year?*

(Aayas)

*The first time I went to Everest Base Camp, I was amazed by how beautiful it is and all of that. But I was also very shocked by how many concerning things I saw that I had not heard about or I don’t think people generally knew about.*

*I remember this specific moment when I was walking on a glacier, the world’s highest glacier; it’s called the Khumbu Glacier. It was at 5,500 meters in elevation, that’s approximately 18 \[thousand\] feet, I believe. And we were walking on a solid glacier, and my foot went into the glacier, so it went into a meltwater pond. And my guide then was shocked and surprised, and he kept saying, “That’s not supposed to happen. This is not supposed to be melting. These puddles weren’t here last week.” And that got me really concerned. That experience is something I couldn’t forget even after I went back.*

*And so I started doing some research, and I started seeing these really concerning headlines, things along the lines of, the region is warming three times faster than the global average, or Everest alone has lost more than 2,000 years’ worth of ice and snow in the last 30 years, and how climate change in the region is expected to impact 1.5 billion people in South Asia. That’s one in every four humans. And so, after hearing all of that and realizing that not a lot of people knew about it, I thought that I wanted to do something. But at the time, I didn’t really know what I could do other than spread the word. So I tabled it for some time, and then I went on my India trip, and this thought of “I should do something” kept bothering me. I couldn’t let it go.*

*Coincidentally, after my India trip, I had other international plans that, because of visa issues, passport issues, or generally COVID restrictions, I had to cancel. And so I took that as a sign that I should go back to Everest. And I told myself, I’m going back. This time I’m going to take my filming gear with me, and I’m going to try to document what I saw and share it with others because maybe if people saw what I saw, maybe if people heard the stories that I heard, they would want to know more about the issue. They would care about it. And so that was the goal.*

*And before I went, I went on the Morehead-Cain Network, and I found Noam Argov. She’s the class of 2015. She’s a documentary filmmaker. So I sent her an email saying, “Hey, I really want to work on this. Do you know it? Do you have any advice, any wisdom for me?” (Hey, Noam, if you’re listening to this, very grateful to you.) But she linked me with this nonprofit called Himalayan Climate and Science Institute, and with them, I was able to work on projects integrating local communities with scientific research.*

*So the project that they were working on aimed to train local community members there to work on weather stations so that we don’t have to, like, fly out technicians and scientists from the other side of the world, which would speed up the data collection process quite a lot.*

(Elias)

*It’s so wonderful that you were able to capture the effects, the disproportional effects that climate change really has on people, especially in communities where people may feel unheard or not linked to media or scientific research. So I’d like to applaud you for all the great work that you’re doing there.*

*Olu, you entitled the portion of your gap year that you spent in Saint Lucia “Solo.” From my understanding, you spent a significant amount of time alone when you were working in Saint Lucia. You frequently mention that you had realizations while you were staying in the country, while you were spending nights and days by yourself. Can you share with listeners what you found to be the value of being alone and any discoveries you had about yourself or the environment?*

(Olu)

*First, being alone, I think the biggest discovery was surrounding learning, and I think I hinted at it earlier where I said the gap year was the year that I felt like I’d done the most learning ever in my life. And I really think that started in Saint Lucia. I honestly wasn’t the most excited as I was when I was going to Tanzania and Spain when it came to Saint Lucia, because I was alone, and I had not been alone for a significant period of time. Even when I was in Costa Rica, I joined a program, I was with a ton of people my age. But now I had an internship with middle-aged individuals, and then I was back in, just me, and that was scary.*

*So I wasn’t really the most excited for it. But again, I leaned into it, and it paid off. I had time to think about, just self-reflect. I had time to engage in different podcasts. I had time to start my Spanish learning and picking up Quizlet. I had time to read. And just by being alone, I learned more about myself. I found interests that I didn’t know I had.*

*And one more thing. Going off of the second part that you had about learning about the environment around me, I think this actually wasn’t done alone, but having that kind of experience where I was more tuned in to the place that I was working and place I was living. I definitely think I had some of those experiences.*

*So one, really quickly, would be working in concierge at a five-star resort. I was surrounded by other employees from Saint Lucia, and Saint Lucia, for those who don’t know, was colonized by the French and by the British, and it was a seven-time colonized by the French and eight-time by the U.K. And just looking at the effects that it had on how people were treated was very, very present. So a lot of folks from the U.K. would go to Saint Lucia for holiday, and I could see instantly the dynamic where the treatment was still from some sort of colonial approach, where, whether it was a demeaning tone or a place of “I’m better than you,” and it was really interesting to just be on the outside of that.*

*And yes, I looked like the Saint Lucians, but when I was approached, and when I was talking with guests, I could instantly see the difference because I didn’t have that St. Lucian background, and maybe having that time reflecting, being in that place where I was learning and creating and exploring my identity as well, I was able to see that in a different lens.*

(Elias)

*It’s so interesting being able to dive into that environment, especially from an American perspective. You kind of get to see the effects that colonialism and systemic injustices have on other countries and how your experience differs vastly from other people’s just because of your nationality.*

*Now, Olu, you mentioned doing a lot of things that you seem to appreciate more while you were alone. For me, I love to channel my thoughts through journaling and blogging. I also spent a considerable amount of time on Duolingo improving my languages. How did you go about expressing yourself, whether that was through journaling or storytelling among friends and family?*

(Olu)

*Journaling was definitely number one. I looked back at it the other day, actually, at my gap year journal, and I had over 60,000 words, I had around 100 pages of journaling, and whether it was only a few sentences a day or two pages a day, and that was more for me. That was more of the self-reflection. That was more of seeing the growth that I had from the beginning of the gap year to the end.*

*But I also had other forms, whether it was my Instagram and keeping people engaged with photos and stories, or whether it was just through photography. For example, in Tanzania, when we were there, actually, during the Serengeti trip, I was able to take over 1.200—1,300 photos and videos, and I still have them as my screensavers today. And just, that being a reminder of what is out there in the world and seeing incredible sites, Ngorongoro Crater, lions hunts, and elephants. And knowing that that can happen, and I lived that, and I look forward to doing something like that. And again, and obviously, that’s all thanks to Morehead, the Morehead-Cain funding that I was able to receive from them.*

(Elias)

*Wonderful. And you, Aayas?*

(Aayas)

*For me, I must say, Elias, it was actually you that inspired me to start documenting more. I remember in the beginning of the year when you and Spence took that road trip across North America, and you had a blog, and you were posting pictures. I remember looking at it and going, “That is so cool. I want to start doing more of that, too, like documenting more of my journeys.”*

*And so I’ve always loved photography. And so when I went trekking, when I went on my different gap year trips, I started taking pictures and posting little story blogs and story sessions on Instagram, and that’s where most of my documenting happened. Personally, I also journaled quite a bit. I had an online journal that has thousands and thousands of words. It’s always nice to look back at some of them and see a year ago I was here doing this.*

(Elias)

*I feel so honored that I inspired you to take a blogging and photography, and I also have to respect you for what you have done with it and how you have gone about documenting your gap year. I have always admired that.*

(Aayas)

Thank you, Elias.

(Elias)

*Okay, this is a tough question. What is your favorite memory from your gap year?*

(Olu)

*I often tell people, I kind of break it up into experiences, and I might cheat a little bit with this question.*

*My favorite experience was the, I think it was seven of us in Tanzania and the Serengeti trip that we had, a seven day experience where we’re living out in tents and we’re hearing hyenas right behind us while we’re trying to sleep, and we’re waking up to elephants tearing down trees. That would probably be my favorite experience.*

*And my favorite trip would be you and me, actually, in Morocco, eight days where were in Rabat, we’re in Marrakesh, and we take a three-day, two-night trip to the Sahara, and we’re riding camels into the sunset and going to sleep in the Sahara and waking up and sand boarding through the dunes. And I would probably say those two experiences were the most memorable and my favorite memories, for sure.*

(Aayas)

*One of my favorite experiences that was actually recurring throughout my gap year was seeing the Milky Way.*

*So I love stargazing, personally, and so to be able to see the Milky Way in the sky from different places: one, from Everest Base Camp when I was surrounded by the glistening peaks, the world’s highest mountains towering over me. Seeing the Milky Way on the night that I bivvied in the Thar Desert—it’s in northwest India. The day that we found an oasis and slept next to it.*

*Seeing the Milky Way from the backwaters of Kerala in a tropical rainforest, and then seeing the Milky Way next to bioluminescent waves on the southernmost tip of South India. That would probably be my favorite experience for my gap year, seeing the same thing across these different places.*

(Elias)

*I know there’s so many things to choose from, and personally, I cannot pick one single favorite memory from the gap year. I think they’re all special in their own ways. My final question for you, if you could give one piece of advice to your pre-gap year self, what would that piece of advice be?*

(Olu)

*Don’t make a plan. That might not be the advice that I should be giving right now, but I think the most important experiences that I had in my gap year weren’t planned. They were made by mistake. They happened because my plan fell through, and I had to come up with something different.*

*I think having that flexibility to find an interest and be in a country, and then that spark an idea of what to do next, where to go next, that would be what I say to do. Don’t have a plan. Don’t create a whole year of what you think you’re going to do because you won’t do it. Lean into the unknown and stick with it.*

(Aayas)

*I really agree with that, Olu. My advice to myself would be very similar. The best place for you is where you naturally gravitate to and not necessarily the path you carve out for yourself.*

*I know you guys know this, Olu and Elias, but for the listeners, prior to going on my gap year trips, I thought Morehead-Cain was really strict with what they wanted me to do and how I could use their stipend. So I produced an 83-page PDF of my gap year plan. I planned every single day. It had maps, it had color-coded calendars, and I ended up doing almost none of that.*

*I’m very glad that it worked out that way, because I would not trade the experiences I had on my gap year for anything.*

(Elias)

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining Catalyze today.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us. It was a pleasure.*

(Elias)

*Thank you for joining Catalyze. I’m Elias Guedira from the class of 2026, and that was Olu Kapano and Aayas Joshi from the class of 2026. You can let us know what you thought of the episode by emailing us at communications@moreheadcain.org or by following us on Twitter or Instagram at @moreheadcain.*

(Abbey Beebe ’27)

*Hello, everyone. This is Abbey Beebe.*

*I am a current gap year scholar, and right now, I’m on an island off the coast of Honduras called Utila, and it’s about 9:52 p.m., and I just jumped into the Caribbean Sea.*

*And I want you to picture every time you move a limb, so you kick or you move your arm, the ocean lights up like a galaxy full of stars. And this is because of the bioluminescence.*

*And it’s truly a magical experience. And it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. And I’m just lucky to be here.*

(Elias)

*It’s mid-October. The sun shines, golden. Transparent, deep blue sky colliding with gleaming sands in the horizon. I look at the point of earth stretching highest to the sun, Erg Chebbi, the tallest dune in Morocco, and among those in the Sahara Desert. An unforeseen impulse rises in me, screaming in me, telling me to climb.*

*I call out to my friend from Arabic class. She wears an orange and black caftan and a scarf, protecting her vision from the sun’s piercing rays. She looks on from a nearby ridge, observing like a tiger. I let her know it could take a while before I come down.*

*I dig my foot into the mountain before me and begin. Grains of sand sift beneath my toes while an hourglass sifts above my head. The sun above me encroaches the earth. As I wear a blue jillaba, I fight its fabric clawing at my feet, holding my movement as I climb. Suddenly, the sand loses grip of the mountain it’s clinging to. The sound of friction as the particles slide. I lose my footing. Now, futilely, I’m stretching my feet and arms into the only surface I can see in front of me.*

*I breathe. Regain control. The sun pulls closer. As I ascend, I hear voices in another language. Blurs of movement behind heat waves. Two tourists enjoying their first days in Morocco. We trade names and stories. We appreciate two vastly different views.*

*I look back to my friend. Behind her neck, tents and base camp. And then, the Hamada. A barren expanse of rock desert. Shale floating on eerily still sand like melting ice on the surface of a lake. Shards of rock cracking and drifting apart. Black mountains fold upward in the distance, indicating the last frontier before Algeria.*

*I turn around towards the sun setting in front of me, an ocean of sand. Waves arcing in every direction, formations that must have been caused by some sort of tempest. Below, at the horizon, riders on camelbacks piercing their way through the rolling dunes like ships in a storm. I stay here for a moment, admiring the stillness from above. Breeze blows from the west. The sun meets earth and back into the quiet storm. I descend.*

(Chandler Beals ’27)

*Hello, everyone.*

*My name is Chandler Beals, and I am a current gap year scholar. And right now, I’m sitting at the Las Vegas airport. I have a layover here on my way home from Baja California Sur, Mexico, where I did the Baja Sea Kayaking course through the National Outdoor Leadership School, NOLS.*

*Yes, I just had a really mediocre panini, and I’m sitting here with my iced coffee, just kind of people watching and reflecting on my trip. I feel very content, very thankful, and also a little sad. It’s hard to live with people for an entire month and really get to know them well, and then, just as quickly as you came, have to leave them behind.*

*With traveling a lot, I feel like my heart’s in a lot of different places, but at the same time, it’s a really good feeling. And, yeah, I leave for Sweden in a week, and I’m really happy to be here.*

## Episode Transcription

(Corrie)

*I think one of the things that I’m super proud of, and really excited about for this year, is some of the work that we’re doing on racial justice and racial equity. Specifically, there’s a study that we’ve commissioned on racial bias in the retail experience. And as that study takes effect this year, there’s a literature review component, there’s quantitative and qualitative research that’s a part of it, and an external team that we’ve engaged to lead it. We’ve also made commitments to action that we’ll take based on the recommendations that come from the research. And so I’m just really looking forward to the next steps there.*

(Sarah)

*And the study on racial bias that you mentioned, did that spawn from anything in particular? I know that this is something that you live and breathe in each day — working on diversity initiatives.*

(Corrie)

*Yeah, so one of the things that we know, which is unfortunately just a terrible reality of our world, is that racial bias exists. It does. And there’s all kinds of independent research out there that shows this, that reflects this reality. And so in a world where racial bias is the norm, how might we work intentionally to mitigate it to create spaces where equity and equality are the norm?*

*The goal here is for this not just to be a Sephora-only effort, but to really see outcomes that can be implemented or are, I guess, recommendations that can be implemented across retail as an industry. And we are committed to leading with commitment-to-action based on what we find, but we will also be holding these findings with open hands to share them with others who are seeking to create a more equitable and just world.*

(Sarah)

*I was just reading up on some of the very neat projects you spearheaded, including Sephora Stands Together, the social impact strategy division, Classes for Confidence for women re-entering the workforce and for those who have gone through cancer, and Sephora Accelerate, the startup incubator. Is there anything you’d want to share about the thinking behind these initiatives and how you get the vision for what you want to prioritize. What else goes in to how you decide what’s to be next and what to dedicate your energy to?*

(Corrie)

*Yeah, so that’s the umbrella of our work, Sephora Stands (“Sephora stands with our people, with our planet, and with our communities”). And we do that through inclusion and diversity, social impact, and sustainability programs. How we decide what to do, or what projects to start, really is, at a simple level, looking at where there are needs in our community.*

*And it was really with that kind of initial framework and lens that we identified the Classes for Confidence program as a strategic opportunity. Teach is a core brand behavior for Sephora so there was already an infrastructure for classes (we offer free classes in our stores). How might we use those classes for greater good? That was the question that my team asked, and what we discovered was that there were some specific opportunities where we could be uniquely Sephora for greater good.*

*And one of those Classes for Confidence became Bold Beauty for gender nonconforming and transgender people, where we create a safe, fun place to try and play with makeup for folks who maybe haven’t had the chance to do that before. The other Brave Beauty classes are for those on a cancer journey. Again, looking uniquely at what Sephora can offer in terms of teaching how to draw eyebrows, how to take good care of your skin while going through some of the drying treatments for cancer. And then workforce reentry has been another one, so we can teach a natural professional a makeup look that’s good for job interviews. So it’s really looking at, again, kind of where the strengths of Sephora meet needs in our communities.*

*The story behind Sephora Accelerate is a fun one because Sephora has this history, particularly in the United States (we’re a French-owned company; our roots are in France) of working really closely with entrepreneurs and helping brand founders to succeed. And it turns out that it worked really well.*

*Sephora has a history of identifying new brands that people haven’t really heard of yet, and then helping them grow and to do well. And when I started at Sephora a little over five years ago, I was curious, looking at the data of our top 100 brands, of what the gender makeup was of the leaders of those brands. And at the time, the majority were led or founded by men in our 100 list.*

*Since then, I’m pleased to share that our fastest growing brands are women-founded and led by women. You know, when you’re a beauty company, a pristine beauty retailer, and the majority of your clients are women, it felt like there should be a greater reflection of women in brand leadership of the brands that we sell. And so we saw the opportunity to take that strength of working with entrepreneurs in building those brands and to focus specifically on supporting female founders of early stage beauty startups.*

*And so that’s what the Accelerate program has done. And this year, we will surpass our goal of supporting and building an ecosystem of support for more than 50 women founders.*

(Sarah)

*Wow, that’s great. And you mentioned that Sephora is a French-owned company or that’s where its roots are. Do you get to use your French that you mastered at Carolina?*

(Corrie)

*I do, I use my French quite a lot. Our global headquarters are in Paris. And so I do make my way to Paris normally only about once or twice a year.*

(Sarah)

*Well, I’m very jealous, but that’s very exciting. As you look back at your Morehead-Cain experience and your time at UNC, are there any of the summer experiences or otherwise that, as you look back now on your career at Google and other nonprofits and so forth, that help you understand how you navigated those choices? I know you were in Thailand, in Zimbabwe, and working in D.C. for the Washington File. Do any of those jump out at you as especially salient and influential as you look back now?*

(Corrie)

*I think there’s so much from my time at Carolina that laid the foundation for where I have gone, you know, what I’ve become, across all of those various experiences that you mentioned.*

*One of the things that I think sticks out to me the most is just the ability to to try new things that you haven’t done before and just to go for it and kind of figure it out, and maybe just the courage to do that and know that it’ll be OK. And I think so often we think maybe, there’s the “traditional path” or the way that things are supposed to go, and my journey has definitely, I would say, not been traditional in that regard.*

*It’s been totally unexpected. I would have never thought that I’d go from working in health care in East Africa to Google to Sephora, right? But just like the summer experiences were so diverse and varied, I think that undergraduate experience kind of prepared me for the courage and curiosity to make some bold choices and to see what that could bring. So it’s been incredibly fulfilling and fun.*

(Sarah)

*And it sounds like that instinct to take a leap kicked in immediately because you were sharing that you moved to San Francisco with your husband pretty early on into marriage without, exactly, this 10 -year specific plan of what you’re going to do next.*

(Corrie)

*That’s true, we did. We moved to San Francisco because it’s where we wanted to be. We didn’t have jobs at the time and figured we would kind of figure it out. And we did.*

*And so, yeah, I think, you know, maybe sometimes we wait or we think that we’re supposed to have it all figured out before we take the next step. And I have found that often, it’s in taking the step that you figure things out. So, yeah, maybe there’s something there. Don’t have it all figured out before you take a step. Take a step, and then you’ll figure it out.*

(Sarah)

*It does always seem like there’s this great pressure to already know exactly what you’re going to do and the way that you’re going to get to whatever looks like success for you, and that maybe it’s not really about that end point at all.*

(Corrie)

*Yeah, I think that’s an insightful takeaway.*

(Sarah)

*Well, is there anything else you’d like to add? We’re recording here on the cusp of Final Selection Weekend, so I know you’ve got a big weekend ahead of you, but anything else you’d want to share to scholars, alumni, and the friends of the Foundation?*

(Corrie)

*Oh, wow, I would just say thanks for listening. And I mean, I am so grateful that I was in the Morehead-Cain program here at Carolina. It has had such a profound impact on my life, and it feels really good to be back. There’s this sense of homecoming I feel from just being on the campus and, you know, walking by the Old Well, and it’s just, yeah, all the warm fuzzies. So thanks for having me, Sarah.*

(Sarah)

*Well, thank you so much for being here.*

# Introducing the new sophomores in the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

New scholars in the class of 2026 (Photos by Ira Wilder ’24)

The Morehead-Cain Foundation is pleased to announce the first cohort to join the Program as part of its [Sophomore Selection initiative](https://www.moreheadcain.org/sophomoreintake/). The students—all sophomores attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill—will join the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026 and will be introduced as Morehead-Cain Scholars at the Foundation’s Fall Banquet on November 16, 2023.

The fifteen scholars come from five North Carolina counties, six states, and China. Their fields of study at Carolina include statistics, computer science, biology, neuroscience, business, history, political science, and education.

Morehead-Cain launched the Sophomore Selection Initiative in September 2023 to identify a small cohort of current sophomores at UNC–Chapel Hill who have demonstrated exceptional scholarship, leadership, and character and invite them to join the Morehead-Cain Program as members of the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026.

The process of selecting the cohort involves an extensive application review and participation in a Final Selection Experience assessed by members of the Morehead-Cain Central Selection Committee. Candidates enter the process via nomination from a wide array of individuals on campus, including professors, department heads, teaching assistants, and staff of scholarship, service, extracurricular, and cultural programs. Transfer students are eligible through partnerships with the North Carolina Community College System and UNC Office of Undergraduate Admissions.

The new scholars join a thriving community of thinkers, leaders, creators, and adventurers at UNC–Chapel Hill, who are empowered to set their potential free. Scholars gain access to a network of peers and mentors, summer enrichment programming, advising, Lovelace Fund for Discovery, funded study abroad, and a living stipend.

The Sophomore Selection Initiative allows Morehead-Cain to “accelerate the journey” of exceptional students who demonstrated their capacity for leadership in their first year at Carolina, according to Morehead-Cain President Chris Bradford.

“UNC­–Chapel Hill is full of emerging leaders with wide-ranging interests and aspirations. We are honored to invest in that potential by offering opportunities to pursue global experiences, design research projects, and access impactful internships,” Bradford said. “The Sophomore Selection Initiative gives Morehead-Cain the opportunity to identify more emerging leaders and offer more transformational experiences to Carolina students who will shape this campus and the world.”

Since its founding in 1945, the Morehead-Cain Program has been a model for countless merit scholarships throughout the United States. These include the University of Virginia’s Jefferson Scholars Program, Duke University’s Benjamin N. Duke Scholars Program, and Emory University’s Woodruff Scholars Program.

High-resolution images of the Morehead-Cain Scholars can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I-QLRWkcvu7Ms04m_81uL6h61GGyQGG6). A biography of each scholar is below.

# The Catalyze podcast: Meet Dr. Brandi Brimmer, Morehead-Cain Alumni Associate Professor in the Department of African, African American, and Diaspora Studies at UNC–Chapel Hill
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Dr. Brandi Brimmer, an associate professor in the Department of African, African American, and Diaspora Studies (AAAD), is one of three Morehead-Cain Alumni Professors teaching at UNC–Chapel Hill.

Catalyze is honored to have [Dr. Brandi Brimmer](https://aaad.unc.edu/faculty-staff/brandi-c-brimmer/) on the series to talk about her first year so far at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, her background in African American social and political history, and her current and upcoming research projects.

[Listen to the episode](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/meet-dr-brandi-brimmer-morehead-cain-alumni-associate-professor-in-the-department-of-african-african-american-and-diaspora-studies-at-uncchapel-hill).

Dr. Brimmer, an associate professor in the Department of African, African American, and Diaspora Studies (AAAD), is one of three Morehead-Cain Alumni Professors teaching at UNC–Chapel Hill. She joined the Morehead-Cain and Carolina communities in summer 2021 from Spelman College in Atlanta, where she was an associate professor of history and a Mellon-HBCU Fellow through the National Humanities Center.

She received her bachelor’s degree in history from Spelman and her master’s in African American Studies and Ph.D. in U.S. history from the University of California, Los Angeles.

To hear more from Dr. Brimmer, [join her online event on Wednesday, February 23](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/networks/events/75051), entitled “Weeping No More: Black Women’s Battles for Civil War Pensions in the Post-Emancipation South.” Her talk is informed by her book, [Claiming Union Widowhood: Race, Respectability, and Poverty in the Post-Emancipation South](https://www.amazon.com/Claiming-Union-Widowhood-Respectability-Post-Emancipation/dp/1478011327) (Duke University Press, 2020).

Learn more about [The Road Back to Chapel Hill](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/networks/events/75047) online event series.

### Working across disciplines to study health, wellness for communities of color

Dr. Brimmer’s appointment was added as part of the [2021 Health and Wellness in Communities of Color initiative](https://college.unc.edu/2021/09/new-faculty-cluster-hire/) within the College of Arts & Sciences. Six faculty members joined the University last fall to conduct interdisciplinary research on a broad theme, including two whose research focuses on issues of U.S. slavery, specifically.

Her archival research from the past decade aims to recover the voices of Black people, both free and enslaved, from the American Civil War Archive. The associate professor’s work on Black communities, both past and present, is “vitally relevant to our current societal moment,” said Dr. Claude Clegg, AAAD chair and a Lyle V. Jones Distinguished Professor of African American and Diaspora Studies.

“Dr. Brimmer’s decision to join the UNC­–Chapel Hill faculty has greatly strengthened the research and teaching profile of the University as well as noticeably enhanced the visibility of the Department of African, African American, and Diaspora Studies as an important nexus for the study of people of African descent,” the chair said. “Her work . . . is in the best traditions of the University’s commitment to scholarly inquiry and community engagement.”

### Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Dr. Brimmer, it’s such a pleasure to speak with you on campus and in person finally.*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*That’s right. It’s good to be here. And it’s a beautiful day.*

(Sarah)

*So you most recently were an Associate Professor of History at Spelman College in Atlanta, and you were also a Mellon HBCU Fellow through the National Humanities Center. So can you share about the research projects you were working on there?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*So my time at Spelman was dear to me. I am a graduate of Spelman College, and so it was really wonderful to return home, as we say. I was awarded the National Humanities Award for HBCU faculty. And then, of course, the pandemic hit. So my time at Spelman was truncated, but it meant that I was coming into North Carolina—and the Triangle, in particular—a year before I actually arrived here at UNC. And there, I was working on a project that extends from my book project, the recently published book, Claiming Union Widowhood, introduced me to a number of just interesting protest movements and black leadership that just hasn’t been written about in Eastern North Carolina. And so one of those figures is a claims agent, which is a short hand term that officials in the Pension Bureau would use to describe what, for all practical purposes, was an attorney. And so, digging through a wide array of archival records, I learned of a person by the name of Frederick Douglass. I believe that he renamed himself Frederick Douglass sometime during the Civil War. He was self-taught, began to teach in the public schools of Craven County, North Carolina, to educate black students, and would go on to represent, in the form of a claim agent or an attorney, represent disabled soldiers, as well as the widows of black soldiers who died as a result of disease or disability or injury during the Civil War. So he’s just an incredible figure. And in building what I’m calling sort of a biography of his life, I’m also thinking deeply about black legal communities in the late 19th century. And so his story is providing an arc or a window through which to think about black legal communities and how working class people engage these communities at the turn of the century.*

(Sarah)

*Well, it sounds like you could just expand on that indefinitely with all of the rich history that you’ve been able to find. Are there other projects or questions that you plan on exploring at Carolina? Is this going to be an extension of the work you’ve mentioned, or what else are you thinking about?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Right now, I’m working on a project—in addition to the Douglass project, which is my priority. But I’m thinking a lot about a history of black intimate life and the possibility of writing a history like that with archival material that I’ve been working with over the last several years. I’m also thinking deeply about the Fort Pillow massacre, the implications and consequences of that massacre for black legal communities as well. And so I’m thinking about a range of different topics, not only that I want to write and think about, but also that I want to introduce into the classroom. And so I’m thinking about also how this research will influence and shape the kinds of classes and questions that I raise with students here at UNC.*

(Sarah)

*And you’ve already mentioned a few of them, but many of your publications, including your book, focus on the lived experiences of black women in North Carolina. And so I’m curious where that academic interest in the state came from?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*When I started the project, people would always say, “Why North Carolina? And why New Bern, in particular?” And my answer to that came over time and after really immersing myself in the archival materials. And my answer to that question now has changed, and it’s simply that free people chose Eastern North Carolina, in particular, as a haven of freedom to expand on pre-existing communities and to think about the possibility of envisions—and implement, rather, I should say, their visions of freedom in the post-Civil War period. And so, I am a historian of slavery and emancipation. I’m deeply interested in questions of gender, family, and community. And in many ways, Eastern North Carolina chose me because I was searching for those questions, thinking about how I might write a project in the Civil War-era period that focused on those questions. And the archival material really led me to Eastern North Carolina. I would add that what it means now is that I’m thinking a lot about public history, and being at UNC puts me in a really unique position to connect with the very communities that I’ve written about. And so, I’m excited about that, in terms of expanding how I’m thinking about my research, and how it connects to not only students, but also communities connected to this institution.*

(Sarah)

*Can you speak to the archival collections that you’ve been able to find or ones that you’re looking forward to exploring now that you have more geographic proximity to the work itself?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Yeah, that’s a great question. UNC Wilson Library, first of all, you all have some of the most talented archivists in the country. They have been extraordinary and one of the most important collections for African American history in the country. And so being here and having proximity to this collection is really—for our historians of black life in the American South—I‘m just in prime position to access a lot of personal papers from former enslavers, to oral interviews, and, quite frankly, speak to communities about perhaps thinking about what it would mean to archive their own collections and keep them in their communities. So, in addition to manuscript archives, collections, and the tremendous library resources I have here, I’m also thinking about the collections that I have that I’ve collected from the National Archives and how those archival findings can actually enhance what I will find at Wilson Library. But thus far, specifically, I would say, my proximity here and access to Wilson Library has allowed me to really look at many of the families who enslaved many of the people that I write about. And so it’s allowed me to think about the conditions of enslavement that individuals survived and challenged and resisted in their path to freedom.*

(Sarah)

*Well, as you said, Eastern North Carolina seemed to choose you, and North Carolina seems to make a lot of sense. But are there other aspects of UNC, in particular, or being in North Carolina that made this position—this opportunity—appealing to you? Is there anything else you’d want to share about that?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Yeah, this is always an interesting question for me when people talk about the appeal of working, when I was going through the application process, and now that I’m here, I’m working with an incredible faculty of leading scholars in the field of African American studies, many who have come before me who have laid the foundation for me to be in this position. And so, I’m thinking about students, I’m thinking about administrators here. I’m thinking about scholars who have, some who have come to UNC and done and produced incredible work and have gone on, and many who are still here, who’ve really created a space for me to be here. And so, in that sense, and I’m really grateful for the groundwork that people have provided. And I hope that I can continue to extend the legacy of strengthening the Department of African, African American, and Diaspora Studies, as well as making significant contributions to the Department of History and knowledge-building around black life in the late 19th century.*

(Sarah)

*We’ll be right back. Stay with us.*

*Join us this spring for a series of campus-inspired events that will set you virtually on the road back to Chapel Hill and the 2022 Alumni Forum. We’ve lined up an impressive slate of speakers for every Wednesday at noon Eastern Time from February 2 through March 9. You’ll hear directly from Morehead-Cain scholars about the ways they’re working to improve Carolina’s campus, from UNC professors about new curriculum initiatives, and from Morehead-Cain alumni who are experts on the University’s governance structure. We hope the opportunity to reconnect with the Carolina campus, as well as the scholars and alumni who comprise this amazing Morehead-Cain community, inspires you to start making your plans to attend the in-person forum this October. More information to come. And now, back to the show.*

*Your work also seems highly interdisciplinary in nature. What sort of collaborations with other departments, other colleges, and schools do you hope to get involved in while you’re here?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Since I’ve been here in North Carolina, I’ve just learned about a number of different projects that are happening across centers, happening through different programs. One program I learned about is a partnership between scholars and playwrights here that actually take a work of academic scholarship and think about what that would look like on the stage. That’s something that’s very appealing to me for now. Those are two things that I’m thinking about in particular. I’m also, quite frankly, thinking about life beyond the walls of UNC, to be at UNC and be in close proximity to the Pauli Murray Center, what would it mean to partner with the Pauli Murray Center, and build on resources that colleagues and scholars here at UNC have already established those relationships. So I’m keeping my eyes open. I’m laying the groundwork for some projects right now and to be continued.*

(Sarah)

*Well, we’re so glad that you’re here, and we’re looking forward to seeing all the great work that you’ll do. I did want to ask, your transition to the University came amidst the national media coverage of Nikole Hannah-Jones, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for whom UNC-Chapel Hill denied tenure and then reversed the decision following the uproar. That must have just been a very difficult time to consider starting a job at Carolina. Is there anything you’d want to share about why you decided to stick with the decision? Was this a factor, or how did you kind of navigate that mentally?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Well, let me say first that Nikole Hannah-Jones was absolutely qualified for tenure here. And when that controversy erupted, I had several different thoughts. And of course, it was a difficult time to think, was I going to carry out this position? I had to think about a lot of things. I had to think about the work that my colleagues in African American and Diaspora Studies had put into the research. And I also had to think about black women colleagues across the profession and across the disciplines, PhDs doing this work and having this experience. And my hope is that what happened with Nikole Hannah-Jones would shine the light on the very particular experiences of emerging scholars who are doing work on slavery and emancipation, but also more broadly, the grueling process it is to achieve tenure, and the very sort of particular obstacles and moving obstacles that black women scholars face, in particular. And so, as this was unfolding, I, of course, was thinking about myself, but I was also thinking very much about the black women colleagues who didn’t have—that were enduring this experience, perhaps being denied tenure, perhaps being rebuked in early reviews, how they were handling that, who didn’t have access to the kind of resources and audience that Nikole Hannah-Jones has now.*

*Let me also say this. What I also had my eye on was the tremendous sort of organizing that I saw from the faculty, as well as the students, and that ultimately pushed me and inspired me to move forward with my decision to come.*

(Sarah)

*I’m guessing, as this was taking place, you’ve been working on this kind of research for a long time, and we’ve been seeing a lot about the backlash towards racial equity curriculum. How do you respond to that when students might bring up the Nikole Hannah-Jones situation in the classroom? Are there things that commonly come up of how you try to contextualize these issues with the research, with this long history of working on these types of issues?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Well, I think all I can do is contextualize it and talk about Nikole Hannah-Jones in a larger trajectory of how black women scholars, and, quite frankly, potential applicants or potential students have been treated. When I think about Nikole Hannah-Jones, I’m thinking about Pauli Murray in her denial of admissions. I’m also thinking about higher education’s larger sort of relationship with black women that in many cases has been adversarial, and I have experienced that as well. So I think the way to deal with it is to be honest about it, to contextualize it, and to talk about the significant intellectual contributions that black women have made, not only to this institution, but to the various fields of studies that students are moving forward with and seeking degrees in. There are significant contributions that black women have made, intellectual contributions that black women have made, that oftentimes just don’t get the kind of attention or recognition that is deserved. So that is what I talk about in the Department of African, African American, and Diaspora Studies has provided a platform for me to do that.*

(Sarah)

*It’s been great talking with you, Dr. Brimmer. Is there anything else you think people would want to know about you, anything you want to share, or that people might be surprised to know about you?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*I don’t know if this is a surprise, but it is sort of interesting to me because I’m born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and so how I ended up at North Carolina, where I’m very pleased to be, by the way, because I had so many incredible mentors and scholars that have come before me. But it is sort of interesting that someone from Los Angeles, California, ends up in North Carolina thinking about these questions. So I don’t know if that’s a surprise, but it is something that I ruminate on and think about as I continue my path here.*

(Sarah)

*Can you share how you did end up in North Carolina, or why did you leave Los Angeles, and when was that?*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Well, that’s part of academic life. I finished my PhD at UCLA, and while I would have very much liked to remain in Los Angeles, looking at a job market across the country and doing my own research. I had to think big, bold, but I also needed to eat and I needed to be employed. I initially accepted a position in Nashville, Tennessee, and since then, I’ve sort of moved about. Certainly my work and my interest in slavery and emancipation has driven that. I mean, I did spend time at the University of Maryland working at their Freedman and Southern Society project, which was transformational in terms of how I think about and approach the subject. But I had to eat, so I had to find employment, and it’s taken me to a lot of different places.*

(Sarah)

*Dr. Brimmer, thank you so much. We look forward to having you at more events, then having your own event, hopefully in the spring, to talk with our scholars and a larger student body.*

(Dr. Brimmer)

*Thank you for having me. I’m looking forward to it.*

### Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Ying, thank you so much for speaking with me.*

(Ying)

*Hi, Sarah. Thanks for having me.*

(Sarah)

*So with your job dependent on the stock market, I’m sure you have some crazy hours. Just how early did you start your work today?*

(Ying)

*Yes, I woke up at four today, and then I got to work by five. Yeah, it’s a little bit tough since I’m based in San Francisco, but work East Coast hours. But it’s something you kind of have to get used to.*

(Sarah)

*Are you naturally a morning person, or is that something that you’ve had to, just as you said, get used to over time?*

(Ying)

*Definitely not a morning person. I used to be a night owl, actually, but after moving to San Francisco, I was forced into my current schedule. But I’ve been on this schedule for about six years now. I’ve definitely gotten used to it and actually have grown to like it quite a bit.*

(Sarah)

*Well, that’s great to hear. I don’t think I’m cut out for investment banking or working with the stock market in any way. But tell us what a typical day looks like for you. Is there such a thing for your role?*

(Ying)

*Yeah, sure. I invest institutional money based on my view of what’s a good stock and what’s not a good stock. I specialize in financial names, so think about banks, insurance companies, brokers. There’s really not a typical day, I would say. First thing, I wake up in the morning; I check for the news. Is there anything, any company-specific news? Is there any macro-news that hit the tape? And if there are news, the next step is to figure out, okay, how does this new piece of information affect my view on stocks I cover? Does that create new opportunities to buy certain stocks or sell certain stocks?*

*Most of the days, there are no sort of knee jerking reactions that need to be done. Then I spend most of my days kind of doing research, think about what’s a good investment, what sort of undercovered opportunities I can work on and figure out. The goal is really by talking to management, by learning about a company, by digging into some sort of industry trend, I can identify overvalued or undervalued stocks and trade based on my conviction level.*

(Sarah)

*Can you break down some of the common approaches? I understand they’re fundamental and quantitative. So can you share kind of the big differences and what someone would need to know to understand?*

(Ying)

*Yes. So there are generally two approaches, I would say, on the opposite end of the spectrum. First is, as you mentioned, the fundamental approach. This is the approach that I grew up with: you’re making a decision—investment decision—based on the fundamentals of a company. So think about what industry is this company and what does this company do differently versus their competitors? How do you think their revenue will trend in the next year, next three years, next five years? How do you think their margin will trend? Who are their management? Do they have a good track record? These are all things I think make up what a company is, and you make a decision—investment decision—based on that view.*

*The second approach is almost the opposite end of spectrum. So it’s the quantitative approach. You start with a large universe of stocks. You don’t really need to know what they do. You don’t really need to know who they are, really. And the only thing you need to know is sort of how have they historically traded. A traditional quant investor, they basically try to find patterns in historical trading behaviors and they use those patterns to form a sort of forward looking view. So historically, when this stock trades up or down a certain amount, then the other stock will follow—something along those lines, some sort of pattern.*

*Fundamental approaches are one, very longer term. So think about your investment time horizon. You don’t care about the next minute or next week or next month. You care about sort of a longer time horizon. How will this company change? You don’t turn over your book as much. You don’t trade as much because if you have a longer term view, it’s not like any view should change in a very short period of time. And it’s subjective. So everyone has opinion on, for example, where Bitcoin is going. That view is very subjective. The quantitative approach is almost opposite of the end of that. There are a lot of quants where their holding period is a couple of minutes or a couple hours or maybe, at most, a couple days. So they trend through their book a lot; they trade a lot.*

*And then lastly, there is no subjective view. All you’re really basing your investment decision on is some sort of objective history and the pattern you’re identifying. So I would say two very different approaches there.*

(Sarah)

*And where would you say your work lies? Would it be more on one or the other, or is there some kind of combination for the sorts of investments that you focus on?*

(Ying)

*Yeah, that’s a very great question. So I grew up on the fundamental side. Ever since I entered this field, I focus most of my energy on learning about company, learning about an industry, talking to management. I would say since maybe two to three years ago, I’ve been shifting a bit more to a quant side. I call it the quantum mental approach. I think it’s very valuable for an investor to understand a company, understand industry. But in the last many years, there’s been this new wave of data that became available, a new wave of tools that became available, that I think can be very good supplements to a fundamental investor.*

(Sarah)

*And I’m hearing not just that it’s important, just as a professional in your field to be able to do this, but also reflecting some changes in the market overall. Can you share some insights of what you’ve been seeing in the kinds of ways that people are investing and maybe how that’s been different than in years past?*

(Ying)

*The first thing we’re seeing is a shift from active investing to passive investing. The way to think about it is the rise of ETFs. I think a lot of people today are very familiar with ETFs. These are, sort of, you can trade a basket of stock at a very low commission cost or low transaction cost. The shift is from investing in mutual funds to investing in ETFs. It becomes a lot cheaper for people to get involved in market. Like, I used 2020 as an example, right. Retail investor involvement in the equity market has grown significantly last year, I think partly because everyone’s stuck at home and had a lot of free time to trade. But partly also, I think, is that in the last couple of years, because of this shift, because of how well the ETF market has grown, the cost of transacting is very cheap now. So I would say that’s a huge industry trend that’s happening.*

*And I think the second thing is that because of the involvement of retail investors, the shift on sort of what kind of investment would like to make has changed a lot, too, because millennials are a lot more involved in equity market nowadays. ESG becomes a much bigger component of investing. You really didn’t hear that much about ESG a couple of years ago, but now that has become a very hot investment theme. Part of, I think, what will drive the need to combine fundamental and quantitative investing is that there’s availability of data now. There’s just a lot more stuff that’s out there that you couldn’t really incorporate into your investment process that you can incorporate today. Those are, I would say, the major things that I will point to.*

(Sarah)

*Well, I want to pivot a little bit to get at your personal story. I know you were an economics major at Carolina and you thought about being a lawyer. So how did you get into this field to start with and kind of find your way to where you are now?*

(Sarah)

*So I was an econ major. I really loved studying about econ. But at the time, sort of, the goal was to graduate and then go to law school. As part of the Morehead-Cain scholarship, I had to find an internship the summer after my junior year. And it’s kind of funny, but when I looked at who is hiring interns, there were a lot of banks. So I was like, oh, why don’t I just try to interview with them, given that I am studying economics. I thought, maybe I can learn something new. So I ended up getting an internship as an equity research analyst at Goldman. I really liked the job, and I thought the job really fit in my personality very well. This is when I started to kind of rethink about my career choice.*

*And then the reason why I say the job fits my personality very well is I really like to kind of dig on a sort of a topic. So I love to say, “Hey, give me a topic, give me a question; I will go find materials to support a hypothesis.” I really enjoy that process, and that’s kind of what equity research is. It’s kind of like playing detectives, but with stocks. Companies say this is going to be the industry trend that’s going to drive their growth for the next five years. But the reality is, when I found that based on the data, they reported that the statement is not true. I just really really enjoy that process. So that’s kind of how I started my career.*

*I was at Goldman doing equity research for about four and a half years, and then an opportunity arrives for a hedge fund job covering sort of a similar space. I actually had a lot of hesitation jumping from an equity research job to an actual investment job. Equity research, you don’t actually do investing; you work on reports. Basically, it’s more like academic, right? You do research and figure out, okay, this is a good stock, and I’ll write a report encouraging my clients to do it.*

*At a hedge fund, it’s very different. It’s real money that you are deploying. So I was very hesitant on making that move for that. There was a lot of hesitation also because I just didn’t know if my personality was going to fit a hedge fund world. I definitely had a lot of preconceived notions about what a hedge fund world is like and what kind of personality would do well in that world, so I definitely had a lot of hesitation there. But I’m super super glad that I made the jump because I found myself actually really enjoying the process of actually investing, putting money to express my conviction level. I truly encourage that. So that’s kind of my story. It definitely started as an accident, but I feel like I’m very lucky because I ended up in a position where I think it’s a job that fits my personality. It’s a job that allows me to grow and constantly be learning new things, learning about how to think about the world. It’s a job that constantly encourages me to kind of be mindful of everything. So I think I definitely got lucky there.*

(Sarah)

*Yeah, and it’s interesting as well to hear how you think about investing. What would you share to anybody in college right now as they’re thinking about looking for jobs and hopefully also getting into investing, even at a smaller level? What sort of advice do you often pass along, in terms of how to think of where they should meaningfully put their money and just how to go about it starting out?*

(Ying)

*My view is that use the college years to truly learn about yourself. I think college is all about self-discovery. Use that time to figure out what are your strengths? What are your weaknesses? What are things that you like to do? What are things you don’t like to do? In terms of personal investing, I do think that it’s a very underappreciated topic. When I was in college, I did not think about investing at all. I did not think about personal finance issues at all. And that’s definitely one of the regrets I have. The norm of what the society suggests is you think about graduating college, you think about getting a job, and you think about working until you’re 65 and you’re retired. Very few sort of people will tell you about, “Hey, you should think about passive investing. Hey, you should think about retirement early. You should think about how to use the money you have to generate more money.” And I think that’s definitely something I wish someone else had told me when I was in college. Investing in a way is both easy and hard, right?*

*I think there are three major components to sort of how to think about investing. The first thing is perhaps the most important—is kind of, what is your worldview, right? What do you think is going to drive the world in five years time? In ten years time? In 20 years time? I am a firm believer that investing should be an expression of your worldview. Investing is essentially putting money behind your conviction. So that’s number one.*

*The second thing about investing is just diversification, right. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Even if you have conviction, don’t put every single dollar you have into one single spot. I think the ETFs is a great solution to that. So whenever you buy an ETF, you’re really buying a basket of stocks. So I think that part has become a much easier problem to solve.*

*And lastly is just have patience, right. Have a very long term view. Keep in mind the purpose of investing. The purpose of investing is you start to put money into whatever investment you like today so that you will get to enjoy the fruit of that many decades later, right? So that will be sort of my personal investment advice.*

(Sarah)

*I wanted to ask, as a female who’s been in this field, what you tell younger women who might have some misgivings about going into a field that is definitely dominated by one sex?*

(Ying)

*Yeah, of course. When I joined Goldman, it was definitely male-dominated, but we had in our cohort or class, we did have a couple of females, so I was never, like, paying too much attention to gender when I was at Goldman because I saw other females, there were definitely other female role models. And actually, I didn’t really think about it as much when I was at Goldman.*

*But it’s kind of funny. When I made the move from Goldman to a hedge fund, all of a sudden, I realized that I was the first female they’ve hired in the San Francisco office ever! I didn’t think too much of it initially, but it was sort of, after a while, I was like, “Oh, that’s kind of interesting!” When I mentioned earlier that I had hesitation about going to a hedge fund, that was sort of part of that hesitation, as well, right? I mentioned that, and I always wondered if my personality was going to fit in. And that personality incorporates gender differences, too. So it was definitely a hesitation. But the funny story is, I thought, I was like, “Oh, I should probably start reading ESPN or try to learn golf or something just so that I can have something to talk to my coworkers about.” I definitely had that mindset when I went in.*

*But once I joined the firm, what I realized was a few things. Number one is I tried to read ESPN. I did not understand really anything. I think I tried it for like once or twice, and that just didn’t work. And then it’s an interesting thing because there are definitely differences, right. So what are topics that male colleagues generally talk about that’s not work related versus topics that I would normally talk about? What I’ve learned is there is really no point in trying to force myself to be more like them. What I mean is, don’t force myself to read the things they like to read, talk about the topics they like to talk about, force myself to be someone that I’m not. One, I’m not good at it. Like I said, I tried ESPN, and it really didn’t work. And then, the second thing is that it’s also not genuine, right? I think the way to establish sort of a really good relationship with colleagues is actually try to be yourself and be genuine. So then it circles back to, okay, I do remember that when my colleagues want to go golfing, and I don’t golf, then what to do?*

*What do you do when you’re different from your colleagues? Whether it’s because of gender, whether it’s because of cultural background, or anything else, it’s okay to stand out a little bit. And instead of just trying to force yourself to be someone you’re not, trying to fit in to be exactly like everyone else. I think that’s something that you have to get comfortable with. But also, I think that when we talk about diversity, what I view that’s most important is kind of diversity of a perspective and diversity of your own history, right? The additive thing about diversity is that you can think about a problem from a different angle than everyone else. You can think about a perspective that’s different than everyone else. And that’s actually the beauty of diversity and inclusion. And I think what I learned through my experience is it’s okay to be different. It’s okay to be not like everyone else because that’s precisely what makes me a bit different than everyone else. And this is precisely what gives me a different perspective on things. Don’t create mental constraints for yourself. So I have often heard people tell me, “Hey, I don’t want to go into hedge funds because it’s a male-dominated industry.” I don’t really think that should affect your career decision, right?*

*I personally think that your career decision should depend on what do you like, what’s your passion, and what are you good at, and really doesn’t, you know, all the external factors such as, like, whether it’s male-dominated or female-dominated shouldn’t be a factor at all. That’s kind of my personal view. There is this myth about I want to pursue a career that’s very stable. And I think that’s kind of one of my hesitations as well when I switched to hedge funds. I’d heard so many horror stories about hedge funds. There is a lot of inherent volatility in the job. I didn’t really know if I wanted to make that jump. And this is also kind of super interesting because when I look back to the cohort of analysts that started with me at Goldman, there are a much bigger percentage of male coworkers who ended up going into hedge funds. I cannot recall anyone else from females to going to hedge funds. And it’s not that they are not skilled enough to get a position if they choose not to go to a hedge fund; it’s because they perceive the hedge fund job to be too volatile.*

*My current view is that there is no such thing as a stable job. There is no such thing as something where there’s no risk. Every job you take has risk, it’s just a different kind of risk. The non-volatile jobs—what that is is it’s very predictable. You have a very predictable stream of earnings. There’s very little ups and downs. Well, those jobs are actually also the most easy to replicate by whether it’s AI, whether it’s someone else, right? So these jobs, they look like there’s not a lot of volatility. But the reality is, I think you’re just trading short-term volatility or short-term stability for longer-term volatility, longer-term risk of being replaced. There is no such thing as permanent stability. I think what is most important is focusing on building a skill set. And eventually what that allows you to do is it doesn’t really matter what kind of environment becomes the dominant environment and how the environment is changing. You have the skill set to adapt to whatever environment. I think that is the most stable thing. I think that’s sort of something I’ve learned.*

*I encourage everyone to read any of Teleb’s book, whether it’s, like, Black Swan or Skin in the Game. I think he really expressed that view very very well. And one last thing—I know you didn’t ask about this, but I would just mention, is—whatever job you choose, always keep in mind why you choose that job. I think it’s very crucial. I’ve seen a lot of people in finance who choose to do this job for the wrong reason. There are people who choose a certain career because it generates a lot of income, or if you choose a career because it sounds really good on paper. I don’t think any of that matters. I think the fame, the money, any job brings you is side effects of kind of how you do the job, right? Don’t do the job because of some sort of external things, that’s not internally driven. Like, I think about passion. I think our purpose is all internally-driven things, and I think about money, fame, everything else is kind of external. Always choose your career based on internal factors and not external factors because I think that’s the only sustainable way to truly do something that you will have to be doing for the next 40, 50 years, right? So I think that’s another thing is spend the time in college figuring out who you are, that will determine what your passion is going to be. That’s going to determine what you like, what you don’t like, your strength, your weaknesses, and those will determine which career you choose. So I think that will be the last piece of advice.*

# Global Perspective Spotlight: Searching for the “heart of golf” in the United States and Scotland, with Jake Patterson ’25
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Jake Patterson ’25 with professional golfer Alyaa Abdulghany

For his Global Perspective summer, Jake Patterson ’25 is traveling throughout the United States and Scotland “on a search for the heart of golf.”

The scholar has been caddying on the Epson Tour for Alyaa Abdulghany, a professional golfer.

The scholar said creating lifelong relationships with people he’s met along the way has been the most meaningful aspect of the summer.

“Golf is more than a score: it’s a dynamic experience that brings so many fascinating people together,” he said. “I’m thankful to the Morehead-Cain Foundation for giving me the support to catalyze these relationships and gain an up-close understanding of what makes golf so special, at all levels.”

[Learn more about Jake’s summer](https://youtu.be/4ESp-sf4Uls).

The Global Perspective summer is an opportunity to conduct an independent research project or learn about a new sector or part of the world through a more traditional internship.

“Working at Tandem has been a life-changing experience filled with so many networking and professional opportunities,” said Kendall, an advertising and public relations major and Arabic minor from Goldsboro, North Carolina. “I feel so blessed to work on meaningful projects with such amazing people.”

The opportunity was made possible by Jim Tanner ’90, president at Tandem.

In the Professional Experience summer, scholars take part in an approved internship or pursue a startup idea of their own. They learn invaluable professional skills that will serve them well in their careers—whether it be in private business, nonprofit, or self-directed entrepreneurship.

# Lovelace Fund for Discovery Spotlight: Serving as head delegation liaison for Perú at the Special Olympics World Games in Berlin, with Parker Prysiazniuk ’25
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Parker Prysiazniuk ’25 went to Berlin, Germany, this summer to serve as the head delegation liaison for Special Olympics Perú through a [Lovelace Fund for Discovery](https://www.moreheadcain.org/scholar-experience/lovelace-fund-for-discovery/) grant. The Special Olympics World Games began on June 17 and go through June 25.

Parker has been involved with the Special Olympics for nearly eight years, starting as a coach and mentor in his hometown of Mocksville, North Carolina.

“My fervor for working with individuals with intellectual disabilities has since grown exponentially, and I am beyond grateful for the opportunity to take my commitment from local to national and global levels,” Parker said. “Being around athletes from 190 delegations around the world is awe-inspiring, and I am excited to be alongside Olimpiadas Espesicales Perú for the rest of the Games. ¡Vamos Perú!”

Following the Games, Parker will complete his Global Perspective summer in Kumasi, Ghana, to conduct public health research for the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and volunteer for the Eleos Cares Foundation, a nonprofit that supports community healthcare projects worldwide.

Prior to Germany, Parker took a stop-out year to travel solo through South and Central America and complete a NOLS India course through the Himalayas. He’ll rejoin the scholar community on campus this fall.

# Gowri Abhinanda ’26 on advocating for gun violence prevention policy
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Gowri Abhinanda ’26

Gowri Abhinanda ’26 has sought to amplify youth voices on gun violence prevention since eighth grade, when the 2018 Parkland shooting twenty minutes away from her home shook her South Florida community.

In high school, the scholar organized peaceful demonstrations to raise awareness of gun violence and founded school and city chapters for youth-led organizations.

Reading about the shootings in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, in 2022 further galvanized Gowri to organize a rally in her community, Weston, Florida, before continuing her activism at UNC–Chapel Hill, she said.

“As students, scribbling ‘advocate for our lives and common-sense legislation’ to our agendas in between calculus and essays is tiresome, but I find it incredibly hard to look away when elementary students are being killed,” said Gowri, a political science and journalism double major.

The scholar served the organization [Brady: United Against Gun Violence](https://www.bradyunited.org/) for two years as part of Team ENOUGH, the nonprofit’s youth-led initiative. She led a lobbying cohort to reach elected officials in support of gun violence prevention reforms in Florida.

This past semester, Gowri represented the nonprofit to meet with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris to advocate for reducing gun violence in the country. The scholar attended a [roundtable discussion on gun violence prevention](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/01/11/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-before-a-roundtable-discussion-on-gun-violence-prevention-charlotte-nc/) at Eastway Middle School in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Gowri delivered a letter to Vice President Harris at the event with ideas and calls to action after thanking her for the administration’s work on the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, a major federal gun safety bill passed in 2022.

“My hope is that continued widespread advocacy from young people will urge our leaders to act in favor of our futures and our safety,” the scholar said.

The recent assassination attempt of former President Donald Trump, which killed one and injured two others, “highlights the necessity for more reform,” according to Gowri.

Missing from the national conversation has been how to implement effective reform, and the fact that the event was a mass shooting, she said.

“A former president being shot is appalling. How many more appalling events need to happen until we act?”

Gowri is the vice president of the Asian American Student Association at Carolina.

# Advocating for elephant welfare in Sri Lanka
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Maya takes care of Mali, an elephant at the foundation, each day.

For her Global Perspective summer, Maya DeCoux ’26 is volunteering with the [Elephant Care Relief Foundation](https://www.elephantcarerelief.com/) in Sri Lanka. The scholar fundraises for rescues, advocates for the ethical treatment of elephants in government-owned facilities, and provides direct care for elephants.

The scholar said she was interested in working with the nonprofit to enhance the lives of domesticated elephants.

“This ongoing journey deepens my commitment to animal advocacy, ethical treatment practices, and mindfulness,” she said.

In addition to elephant welfare, the scholar has been participating in Buddhist meditation sessions and mindfulness retreats guided by monks and nuns at local temples.

The experiences have shaped her “pursuit of mindfulness, inner peace, and happiness” while “minimizing personal greed and negativity,” she said.

Maya has also volunteered in environmental initiatives, such as rehabilitating injured turtles for their release into the wild at [The Green Lion](https://thegreenlion.net/) and teaching English at local schools.

“Through direct experience and cultural immersion, I continue to gain invaluable insights into sustainable conservation and personal growth, fostering connections that will guide my future endeavors in global welfare and mindfulness advocacy,” the double major in psychology and neuroscience said.

The [Global Perspective](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/summer-programs/global-perspective/) summer is an opportunity to conduct an independent research project or learn about a new sector or part of the world through a more traditional internship.

For his Professional Experience summer, Jake Rose ’26 is working at [Handspring](https://www.myhandspring.com/), a prosthetic clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah.

As part of his internship, the scholar designed a 3D-printed arm and elbow system for a shoulder disarticulation and assisted in the creation of a prosthetic that can be used for rock climbing.

The scholar said he’s been able to “experience the entire prosthetic process” at Handspring, from participating in patient meetings to product design, manufacturing, and final delivery. The clinic develops specialized devices for patients with highly specific requirements.

“The ability to brainstorm directly with the patient to bring their goals and feedback to life within minutes is an incredibly unique opportunity that I have enjoyed immensely,” he said.

Jake has also been able to experience the beauty of the southwest United States through weekend backpacking trips.

“I’ve grown my passion for photography and captured beautiful environments while appreciating the vast and empty landscapes, he said.”

In the [Professional Experience](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/summer-programs/professional-experience/) summer, scholars begin to explore the transition from Carolina to the working world by pursuing a professional internship.

# The Catalyze podcast: Consultant and entrepreneur Bradley Opere ’17 of FarmMoja: ‘Africa is a place that a lot of people are waking up, step by step’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

As an undergraduate student at UNC–Chapel Hill, Bradley Opere ’17 was the first student from Africa to be elected student body president.

Bradley Opere ’17 is the co-founder of [FarmMoja](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=farm+moja&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), an agriculture social enterprise in Nairobi, Kenya.

Bradley joined Catalyze to share about what got him interested in the agriculture industry, how FarmMoja is working to rehabilitate land and support smallholder farmers, and why it was important for the alumnus to return to Africa after graduating as a Morehead-Cain Scholar.

For his day job, Bradley is now a consultant at Dalberg. Prior to joining the global consulting firm, he was a young leadership fellow at McKinsey & Company. The entrepreneur co-wrote an article with McKinsey colleagues in the spring of 2020 about the [impact of COVID-19 on Africa’s food systems](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/safeguarding-africas-food-systems-through-and-beyond-the-crisis) and what governments and private actors can do to respond.

As an undergraduate student at UNC–Chapel Hill, the alumnus was the first student from Africa to be elected student body president.

### Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Bradley, thank you so much for speaking with me.*

(Bradley)

*Pleasure is all mine, Sarah. Thank you so much for having me, too.(Sarah)I’m looking forward to speaking with you about FarmMoja. But first, I wanted to just ask about your day job, working as a consultant. Can you share about what you do and what a normal day might look like for you?*

(Bradley)

*A day in my life typically is just trying to learn something new about a particular industry and offering new client insight on it. For today, specifically, I spent the whole day at a lime factory doing lime sector analysis. So, my shoes are covered in white limestone, which I absolutely love because it’s consulting and it’s an agricultural project that I’m passionate about.*

(Sarah)

*Well, I’d love to ask about FarmMoja now. I remember on a recent call you said “Moja” means “one” in Swahili. Can you share with us about the context for starting the startup and why you thought this would be something that you wanted to apply your skills locally?*

(Bradley)

*Yeah, FarmMoja essentially specializes around developing integrated value chains for transformative long-term agricultural crops. I got extremely interested in agriculture when, right after graduating, I left the U.S. to go start working in South Africa for a company called Pactorum, which is the fund managers for Fairfax Africa. And they were managing private equity funds that they were looking to deploy across different companies. And one of the portfolio companies that had already been acquired was a company called AFGRI. It’s one of the largest agricultural companies in the Southern hemisphere.*

*During my experience there, I realized just how significant agriculture played a role across the whole continent. In Kenya, specifically, agriculture contributes to about 35 percent of the GDP of the country. I would spend a lot of time looking at spreadsheets on different crops, meeting with different people in the ag industry, and just kind of developed a keen sense for it and a keen passion for it because of just the large numbers of people you could impact in Africa with the industry. And I luckily was taking a flight back home and met one of my childhood friends, Kevin. He was doing avocados, I decided I just wanted to partner with him. That’s kind of how I ended up with FarmMoja.*

(Sarah)

*So can you tell us about the crops that you are focusing on now and as well as any that you might be moving towards to account for these very different kinds of harvesting timelines?*

(Bradley)

*The crops we are focused right now on is . . . Our first crop was avocados. The demand and supply gap at the moment for avocados is quite large, and the second crop outside avocados that we’re looking at getting into next is macadamias. Once again, another long-term value crop that takes about four to five years before it gives you its first crop, but fetches extremely premium pricing. The final crop that we’ll be looking to get into as well is also blueberries, which is a bit of a shrub but extremely high margin and life-changing if we can get mass adoption for it due to the demand in export markets.*

*And all these crops don’t have established value chains yet in East Africa. We do have some players who are doing really well, but the industry is a bit nascent and so it allows you to build everything right up to the processing lines for each of these.*

(Sarah)

*I’m curious, too, when you were speaking about the Kenyan climate, about just how sensitive these crops might be to a warming climate, and if that is something that might make it, short-term, more favorable or if that is a concern. I’m thinking of coffee beans in Costa Rica and how the climate crisis is already causing a lot of anxiety there for the long-term plan. So I’m curious to hear if that’s also part of the calibration or if these crops are not so sensitive, that they should be fine decades from now.*

(Bradley)

*Most of the crops that we look at, yes, they are climate sensitive, in the sense that the production levels may vary depending on temperatures, but they are also extremely hardy. Avocados, coffee bushes to an extent, as well as macadamias, are trees. Avocados and macadamias more so, and so they remain extremely resilient to different climatic conditions. However, what does happen is the yields that you have potentially decreases depending on different climatic conditions. And so even though the tree may survive during harsh conditions, your yield, however, may start varying considerably depending on how badly the climate change effects end up being. And so it’s something we are monitoring very closely. California as well, which is a great avocado growing area, has suffered through some of these climate changes, and we’re observing how that’s affecting their production. And so it remains a constant worry, not just for Kenya, but for global food supply. Perhaps diversifying where we are planting our food is one solution.*

(Sarah)

*Yeah, I remember when we were on a Zoom talking about the company, you shared about some of the sustainability goals that you have and as well as some of the ways that you’re going to go about it, like rehabilitation through trees. And you shared about the link between avocado trees specifically and carbon reduction (which, as a millennial, of course avocados are somewhat self-consciously part of my diet, so was interested to hear that). But can you share more of how you’re thinking, as the co-founder of the startup, where you want to go with sustainability and how you’re organizing your priorities about that?*

(Bradley)

*First off, the fact that the average macadamia or avocado tree can grow for as long as 20 years is extremely good because it’s a tree and you’re just picking its fruit. So you’re not uprooting it and planting new trees as compared to perhaps wheat or maize every planting season. And that’s really good for soil health, right? Because you’re not taking anything out of the ground for the most part.*

*Two, we also really big on organic practices across all our farms, and so we try to use very little, if not at all, any fertilizer past the third or the fourth year of the tree establishing itself just to ensure that there’s nothing washing off into any rivers or any places. And also we eat the food ourselves, and we like to go organic as well, just because it’s healthier.*

*Thirdly, avocados being the tree and having the 20–25 year lifetime, as well as macadamias, also means that they end up growing huge canopies shading the soil underneath and also having a lot of carbon-sequestering ability. And so actually, how business is divided is we do have a particular unit that’s focused on developing more commercial orchards. And just this coming year, we’ll probably be putting about 9,500 to 10,000 trees, which will be rehabilitating a former wheat farm and helping to create reforestation within an area that’s just lost a lot of trees. And we’re thinking that providing trees that can offer such economic value to locals who are close to forested areas is a long-term solution, because if you don’t offer them any economic value for their land, then they’re going to chop down the trees next to where they live. And so it’s an extremely appealing . . . it’s an extremely appealing proposition for us to help increase smallholder farmer income ability, which would hopefully then allow them to more actively participate in keeping more trees in the forests because they have more income.*

(Sarah)

*I’d also like to ask about some of the future plans that you have. You shared about a big investment from ADAP Capital, as well as a matching grant. So, share about the initiative and what you’re going to use the funds for.*

(Bradley)

*Raising funding, especially in Kenya, is an extremely difficult thing. You often are having to speak to investors around the world, some of whom may not necessarily have the nuances and the understanding around how the continent works and the different nuances around specific countries.*

*And so we are passionate about being part of entrepreneurs who can help pave this, especially within agriculture. We got our first funding from ADAP Capital, which was $75,000. That really helped us kickstart a good number of the farming operations that we’re doing, from building our nursery to establishing our commercial orchard and helping our smallholder farmer unit begin their harvest period.*

*We also then got access to a matching grant based off of that funding from the Anzisha prize in South Africa of $50,000. And that’s then going to help us further build on the establishment of a commercial orchard, set up the appropriate irrigation systems, as well as expand on our nursery, which is having extreme demand in terms of our seedling production. It’s currently at a capacity of 20,000, and we can’t satisfy the demand that we’re having for that.*

*We are working to attract additional capital and absorb up to $500,000 over the next two years. And this will also allow us to set up a pack house. This will then allow us to do direct exports of our crops from Kenya to different countries that we’re looking to establish partnerships with, and that allows us to fetch premium prices and offer our farmers additional money, as well as our plans are underway to get the relevant organic certification that’s needed so that the fruit can also fetch premium pricing. So that’s the short-term plan. We’re still hitting the road, and yeah, it’s a discouraging road sometimes, but it’s also fun sometimes when you get the big win, but slow but sure, we’ll get there.*

(Sarah)

*Sounds like you certainly have a lot of momentum going right now. I want to return to what you said about how there is sometimes a difficulty in sharing with investors the kind of startups there are in Kenya. Can you share a little bit of what you meant by that and how you kind of help them understand what you’re trying to pitch in order to be able to receive that funding?*

(Bradley)

*We try very much to really deeply find champions within our networks, who have had some experience in the continent, who had experience investing, and are now on our advisory board, who can help us bridge some of these gaps with investors, who may not be familiar but are interested in some of the impact that can be had on the continent.*

*It’s a question of finding a few champions and communicating extremely clearly on what our goals are and executing unrelentingly on them and having a clean track record that other people can be able to look to and believe because it’s easier to show rather than tell. But it’s a slow process.*

*We think not just Kenya, but a lot of Africa is a place that a lot of people are waking up to, step by step. We saw companies like FlatAway hit unicorn status and be valued at a billion dollars in the tech scene. Primary agriculture and processing agriculture is a whole other different game altogether that’s perhaps less sexy, but there’s a lot of value as well to be had within the industry, and we’re excited to be scratching the surface and paving the way for that, hopefully.*

(Sarah)

*I just wanted to close with asking why it was important to you to go back to Kenya, and if you see yourself long term there or what other aspirations you might have.*

(Bradley)

*It was always important for me to just come back to Africa or Kenya, anywhere around Africa would do for me. I just always firmly believed every time I sat in my classes that a large number of my colleagues were from the U.S., and I thought they were really great, more intelligent than me in many ways. And I was like, a majority of them will spend a good amount of their time improving America and so I felt like America had so much talent for it that I needed to take whatever little I had learnt back home and contribute there, and so I was really happy to come home.*

*I felt like I would miss out on joining other leaders around the continent who are helping shape and drive things, and I wanted to be part of that story rather than look at it from the outside in. I’m happy to do anything contributing to the continent, even if I end up not working in Africa, specifically. As long as I do a job that’s helping the continent move forward, I’ll probably be happy. I think there’s a lot to be done here so we’ll see how that goes.*

(Sarah)

*Well, as I’ve been hearing you, it’s amazing to me because each of the things that you’re involved with could easily be more than a full-time job but it’s so clear that you’re making a big impact in the communities that you’re serving. And I really appreciate your time with us so thank you for sharing about your work.*

(Bradley)

*Thank you so much for having me, Sarah. It definitely is a pleasure for me. Hopefully we are successful and we can get to helping a million farmers in this continent over the next decade or two.*

(Sarah)

*It feels like I might be jinxing it by saying we hope that you’ll be at the next Alumni Forum or see you in Chapel Hill, but we do hope that you’ll be around at some point in your travels or work.*

(Bradley)

*I miss Chapel Hill. I need to get myself one of my Carolina jumpers because I’m running out of Carolina gear, so yes to that. Yeah.*

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Rob, thanks so much for speaking with me today.*

(Rob)

*Hi, Sarah. Thank you so much for having me on.*

(Sarah)

*The last time I checked, you were a video producer for the L.A. Times. Can you share about that experience and what inspired you to take the leap into freelance?*

(Rob)

*It was a really foundational experience for me. Every day, I was constantly hopping between a lot of different projects that demanded a lot of different styles. Some of the projects were a little more cut-and-dry journalism pieces but others allowed me to—they were still journalism but were more feature-oriented—allowed me to bring a little bit more of a vision to it and a little bit more creativity to telling the story.*

*The longer that I was there, I realized that the projects that I looked to the most for inspiration, and the projects that I most wanted to create eventually in my career, those weren’t necessarily being done by people who were working at newspapers or at journalism outlets, necessarily. They were produced by, in large part, people who are freelancers.*

*One of the things that I started to see once I got into the industry was that even the longer-form documentary stories that are produced at newspapers are generally made by partnerships between newspapers and independent filmmakers or newspapers and video-centric video production companies.*

*Obviously, the work that video journalists do is incredibly important, and there’s a need for that, but the niche that it fills wasn’t necessarily where I saw myself going long term.*

*I also wanted a little bit more ownership over my work. I started thinking about freelance earlier on, and then the question was when to make the jump. It’s been a wild time to become a small business owner, but I’m really fortunate to have been able to make it work so far.*

(Sarah)

*I mean, to make that kind of decision in the middle of the pandemic must have been probably a little scary? Or was it mostly just optimistic because you knew that the time was right to do something for yourself?*

(Rob)

*It was definitely really scary. Initially, I didn’t anticipate making that jump. During the pandemic, I’d been thinking about it a little bit off and on. It was just luck and happenstance that I ended up having an opportunity to actually, for a moment, step outside the paper and work on an external project.*

*I was contacted by a production company that I had actually interned with in my time at Carolina. It was one of my Morehead-Cain SEP summers.*

(Sarah)

*Miles O’Brien Productions?*

(Rob)

*Yeah, Miles O’Brien is the science correspondent for the PBS NewsHour, and he runs a production company. It used to be out of Boston when I interned with them. They produce a lot of science-focused content, and that’s a bit of my forte. I really like that kind of content. I had a chance to intern with him in college and had just kept that connection alive and kept reaching out and talking with my friends there.*

*They were looking at doing a NOVA documentary about electric airplanes, and it just so happens that a lot of the companies who are doing that kind of work are in California. They needed someone out here to do a lot of the filming for it and work on shoots to fulfill a lot of roles, including audio and lighting and filming. They reached out while I was at the paper and they said, “Would you be available to do this and join us for a couple of weeks of filming here and there?”*

*This is something that I was really interested in, and obviously, it’s a PBS Nova film. It’s an incredible opportunity to work on something like that. So, I ended up requesting to take a sabbatical from the paper to work on this project. What started as a sabbatical turned into a resignation and going freelance full time.*

*I was really lucky to have a chance to just take a step out of that door in a safe way. I could come back to the job—that was my plan at the start of it. But I think once I took that step out, I saw that for me at least, the grass really was greener. It’s not without its own drawbacks, but just having a chance to step into the freelance world and work on a project that’s in the style that I really wanted to be working on (longer-form documentary storytelling) made me realize that it was doable in the moment. And yeah, I made the jump.*

(Sarah)

*What are you curious about pursuing now? Are you thinking about any specific issues that you want to tackle or do you even have a specific documentary in mind that, if you had the time and resources to do it, you’d want to pursue?*

(Rob)

*Some of the stuff that I’m most interested in working on are stories that are really immersive for audiences. What I mean by that is when people generally think of documentaries, a lot of the time when you watch a documentary on TV or even on a streaming service, there’s generally a lot of information. That’s the typical model. There’s a lot of information, usually a narrator or reporter leading someone through a story. It’s packed with a lot of statistics and relevant information.*

*Those documentaries have their place, and they’re really important but I also see this need for documentaries that can really pull someone into someone else’s experience and maybe convey information and emotion using some of the same language that’s not really used in documentaries, but maybe more so used in cinema.*

*When you go in and you watch a film in a movie theater, you generally expect something or you expect a very different experience than watching a documentary. The fundamental language that’s used between the two genres, generally, can differ a lot, it can differ a little, but there are more and more films coming out that are exploring the style called cinéma vérité.*

*This style has been around for a while. Honeyland would be a great example of a recent, well-known film that’s in pursuit of that style, of really immersing an audience member in someone else’s experience and using that as a means to convey meaning, to convey information.*

*In terms of looking at the environment. It’s hard to find stories that do that. When you’re talking about climate change, for example, something that often comes to mind is glaciers melting. While that’s horrific that’s taking place, for the average person, it’s hard to see how that connects into daily life. It’s hard to watch clips of animals in the Arctic or these processes that are slow enough that it’s hard to convey on screen. These processes are taking place, and it’s just hard to really get these things to really hit home with many people in the audience just because it’s hard to relate to these things. These things are abstract. They happen over longer periods of time. They’re not really in your day-to-day life.*

*For me, an area that I’m increasingly interested in focusing on that deals with that is wildfires. I had a chance to cover a couple of wildfires while I was at the Los Angeles Times. The experience of being in that environment, with the fire raging around you, it’s one of the most visceral, immediate examples that I could think of off the top of my head that really shows the impending crisis that we’re all starting to go through now, and that we will be experiencing in the next ten, twenty, thirty years.*

(Sarah)

*There is something so pressing about actually looking out your window and seeing an orange haze because a fire is just miles away in that it doesn’t feel so distanced, like a glacier melting, which few of us will probably get to go see, but something that’s a bit more day-to-day and in your face.*

(Rob)

*Absolutely. Especially for people who are out on the West Coast. Last year, we had a really awful set of fire complexes in Northern California, where in San Francisco, the sky was orange. Here where I live, in Chico, out in rural California, there was a day where it rained ash, and the fires weren’t even at our doorstep. But it clouds the air. There’s like a haze whenever there are fires about, and it almost seeps into every aspect of life.*

*I think, granted, someone on the East Coast, or people who live in areas that aren’t as prone to fire, probably can’t share that experience. But just knowing that there’s this intersection of this intense, visceral fire and people coming together, there’s like this intersection there that’s really intense and immediate. There are stories that take place all around that, from preparing to during to after, the healing process. There’s so much there that’s relatable and immediate and visceral, and that has the power to be immersive. So, focusing on stories like that is something that I’m really interested in working on in the future. I also have a little bit of this wild idea for how to film it, too.*

(Sarah)

*Tell me about this.*

(Rob)

*If anyone had a chance to see 1917 this past year, year and a half, it came out. It’s filmed by one of my favorite directors of photography, Roger Deakins, and it was presented as if the whole entire movie was shot in one single take. There’s no cuts. There’s no different shots. It is shot as if it’s just the camera moving through the landscape, following the characters, and it’s by no means the first movie to do this.*

*There’s a lot of theory behind this, and I could talk at length about why it works this way but when you’re presenting a film to an audience that contains such intense subject matter, and you don’t include any breaks or any cuts for them to be able to really even blink, it just becomes so immersive and so much more intense. It really doesn’t even give the audience a chance to really even look away or catch a breath. It’s really almost relentless, in a sense, even though there’s no fast cuts, it’s just like one long take.*

*I’ve been trying to look into it, and there are reasons for this, but there aren’t any documentaries that really take place in one cut, that’s really moving through a landscape that develops characters, and that takes you through a story in that way. I’ve been thinking about the intensity of wildfires and really trying to immerse an audience in the human experience around that to really convey what’s going on. I’ve been thinking about the idea of trying to do it in maybe even one take or several really long takes.*

*The work that would have to go into that is fairly immense. It’s not as easy as just like going out and just filming for an hour with a camera. It would take a lot of prep work, and it would probably take a lot of tries before getting the right take. But the thought of trying to create a really immersive documentary in that way is really interesting to me, and that’s something that’s pie in the sky that I’m dreaming about. Maybe I’ll have a chance to make the documentary at some point.*

(Sarah)

*You’re also working on natural disasters with Doug to the Rescue, which I’d love to talk about next. Tell us where the idea for the show came from and why you got involved, why you wanted to get on board.*

(Rob)

*Yeah, so, back when I was working on the NOVA film during the sabbatical, and right after I went freelance, the other cinematographer that was working on that project had just pitched the show and got into proof of funding, and we started talking about it and it immediately caught my interest.*

*The show originated when this cinematographer was in the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian. He was there doing more or less just general news coverage, and he ended up running into this guy named Doug, who was flying this really sophisticated drone for the purpose of rescuing animals that had been separated from their owners or that had been stranded after the storm, who are basically left helpless on their own.*

*He immediately befriended him. They started talking about the possibility of doing a bigger documentary project about Doug’s work just because it’s so interesting, and they were able to pre sell it through Curiosity Stream as one of their first original series.*

*The reason why it stood out to them was the same reason that I got really interested in it. There are a lot of animal rescue shows out there. That concept isn’t really new. But what makes Doug’s show so different is there’s this really interesting intersection of technology that really has only become commercially available in the past couple of years.*

*There’s a connection of that with all these environmental issues. He’s going in and rescuing animals after these events that are becoming more intense and more frequent because of climate change. Those topics are intersecting over this core mission of wanting to go and save the helpless, like rescue these helpless animals that, if left on their own, would perish.*

*So, it’s these interesting themes intersecting over a show that at its core has a lot of heart. It just so happened that the cinematographer who had pitched the show, who is an executive producer on the show, he was tied up in a lot of different projects that he had already committed himself to, and they needed people, at the spur of the moment, hop on these trips after natural disasters, which we couldn’t plan for. He said, “Would you be interested in working on this in a big way?”*

*Coming out of the project, he had seen a little bit of my work, and we had a chance to work together, and he got to know me that way. He felt comfortable enough and asked me to be a part of it. I was absolutely on board because at that point, too, I was so early in my freelance career, I had a lot of availability. It just really worked out.*

*The first shoot that I went on was in Louisiana after Hurricane Laura. It had devastated this small city called Lake Charles, and there’s a lot of news coverage about it. Doug was debating on whether or not to go. We were trying to make sure that things would work out on the ground.*

*Really at the core of it, this was so early in the production process, and this was the first season of the show. There wasn’t a formula or a template for determining whether or not certain locations or certain events would work out for us that Doug would have a lot of animals to rescue. Initially, it was a really small team that they sent to Louisiana, because in their minds, they were saying this might be a total wash. There was funding but it was the first season of the show. There wasn’t a huge budget for it.*

*Really, for most of the time there, it was just me, one other producer, and Doug. We were sent down for what initially, they said, like, maybe it’ll be a couple of days, we’ll feel it out and see from there. What initially might have been only a couple of days ended up turning into almost two weeks of really long filming. Because the show hadn’t been super established yet, there were some things that we talked about going into it, but because there was so much blank canvas to work with, I had an opportunity to really bring my own style and vision into the making of those episodes.*

*In Louisiana alone, we pulled out two episodes from that trip of the six. I was with them for other shoots, too, but that was the first time that I was on the project. I just felt so lucky to be working on a project that was going to be distributed, had funding like that, but also be able to really have the creative freedom to bring my own eye into it. I feel like that’s at a higher level, at a higher caliber. Those opportunities are a lot more rare.*

(Sarah)

*Yeah, well, especially after, as you said, you were hoping for more creative freedom at the Los Angeles Times, as wonderful as a first job that it was, and just less than a year later, essentially, to be working on this, is just really exciting. My last question is, what does the word “tequila” mean to you at a personal level?*

(Rob)

*On a personal level, Tequila is my dog. My partner and I ended up rescuing him off of the show, Doug to the Rescue, spur of the moment. But Tequila and I make an appearance on the show. I make a little cameo.*

*But backing up a little bit more. I grew up with dogs. I grew up with rescue animals. In my mind, I knew at some point that was going to happen. I was going to try to adopt the dog. I didn’t know when that would be, and I thought it would be a lot further down the road.*

*But when I hopped onto this show, you’re out there rescuing animals who are just so helpless. All they want to do is to have a home and to just love you and just to be loved. It’s one of the most pure expressions of love that I’ve ever experienced. Do you want me to go into the backstory of how we found him?*

(Sarah)

*Yes, please do.*

(Rob)

*So, it was late, really late at night in Louisiana. One of the quirks of the show is that, for the drone to work, it uses an infrared camera. It has to fly at night, so we would work long hours into the night. At three or four a.m., we were wrapping up. It had been a really, really tiring night. We had filmed a lot. We had picked up a lot of cats and dogs, and Doug and I were driving back to pick up the producer, who had been sitting with some of our equipment. Suddenly, as we’re driving, this dog walks through the beam light on the sidewalk.*

*Doug looked over at me and he said, “Should we rescue that dog?” In my mind, we were like, “Oh, we’re really tired. It’s really late. We don’t have a kennel for it.” But we decided to go for it. He wanted to do it since the dog was right there. We wanted to at least give it a shot.*

*Tequila was really skittish at first but clearly wanted to be friends. He had gone at least ten days scavenging for food and water on the street. He was really hungry, and we were able to eventually get him over and put a leash on him. It took a while to coax him in and get him into the car.*

*We didn’t have a kennel because we were working with a group there that had all that equipment, and they had already gone back to the shelter. The only option was for Tequila to sit in the back of the car with me. At that point, he didn’t have his name. But in my mind, this dog had just been through probably what was one of the worst experiences of its life, where it had been on the streets through a hurricane and then had to scavenge for food for ten days and find water.*

*After an experience like that, I would be really angry. But Tequila, riding all the way back to the shelter in the car, he just put his head on my shoulder, and he gave me a hug the whole way back. In that moment, it just became clear, like he went through all that ordeal and was just still at the end of the day, so loving and sweet and kind. It just broke my heart wide open. I don’t think I could not adopt it at that point.*

(Sarah)

*If only you knew at the time of leaving your job that, not only would you be working on this cool project, but you’d also have a new addition to the family.*

(Rob)

*Yeah, who knew?*

(Sarah)

*Rob, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Best of luck with all of your projects, right now and the ones to come.*

(Rob)

*Thank you so much, Sarah. Take care.*

# Shivam Bhargava ’22 on the Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South: ‘I left this trip feeling inspired and motivated to make a change’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Shivam Bhargava ’22, Dr. Benjeil Edghill ’98, Pam Kelley, and Dinita James ’81 on the second day of the civil rights tour in Birmingham, Alabama.

Written by Shivam Bhargava ’22, program manager at Asian Health Coalition in Chicago and a Global Health Corps U.S. Fellow

In April, I participated in the [Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/news/1981542) with around thirty alumni and guests to learn more about our country’s history and struggle for racial justice.

As a public health professional who works with communities of color in Chicago, it is critical for me to understand the historical context of the inequities and discrimination I see in the communities that I work with. By making these connections to history, I hope this will prepare me to be a more caring and compassionate physician prepared to treat individuals of all backgrounds.

**This trip gave me the space to think deeply about systemic racism and how that relates back to modern day social issues like health disparities and education inequities**. I left with a better idea of how history relates back to today.

I was able to connect the parallels between the civil rights movement and segregation to issues such as police brutality and the Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action. I left this trip feeling inspired and motivated to make a change, knowing that history is still repeating itself in many ways in our country today.

**One of my favorite moments from the trip was connecting with alum Dave Brunson ’64.** After realizing that I was the youngest alumnus on the trip, and he was the oldest alumnus, we immediately connected over our stark differences in experiences at Carolina.

I asked Dave for one piece of advice for my future, and he said to “never stop learning, no matter what age you are.” I was inspired by his advice as I watched him take notes throughout the trip on everything he was learning related to the civil rights era.

I was impressed as he pulled out his iPad and jotted down new epiphanies and reflections after going through every museum room. As I continue to progress through life, I only hope to have half the thirst for knowledge and love for learning that Dave continues to have.

The next trip will be to London from September 22–29, 2024 to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the British Morehead-Cain Program. [Learn more about group travel through Morehead-Cain Alumni Journeys](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/page/alumni-travel).

# Morehead-Cain Mentor Andrea Stumpf ’84 on taking an ‘exploratory approach’ to mentorship
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Andrea Stumpf ’84

Written by Cate Miller ’25, Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team

For Andrea Stumpf ’84, serving as a Morehead-Cain Mentor was a perfect way to “make a difference” as an alumna.

During their first conversation, Andrea was surprised at how much she and her mentee, Ann Goulian ’25, had to talk about. (The Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program pairs scholars with alumni based on shared values and interests.)

“Our meeting was informal but quite wonderful, with a fluidity to the conversation,” she said. “We were able to quickly enter our comfort zones, naturally gravitating towards discussion surrounding women in the working world.”

The experience of being a mentor has affirmed for Andrea that there may indeed be some words of wisdom she has to offer as an experienced professional, she said.

“It’s very validating for the person you’re helping, but it’s also extremely validating for yourself, to draw from your past and make something useful out of it for someone else,” said Andrea, principal at [Structured Partnerships](https://www.structuredpartnerships.com/) in Kensington, Maryland. “It’s a simple and discreet way to help.”

Throughout their meetings, she’s encouraged Ann to pursue opportunities that are different from the ones the scholar has done in college and through the Summer Enrichment Program.

“As you expand your experiences, your ability to see the bigger picture increases more and more,” the alumna said. Before founding her own partnership advising firm, she worked in government, law firms, private companies, and a multilateral development institution.

Andrea said mentoring conversations are often open-ended, allowing her mentee the freedom to choose the focus.

“We take an exploratory approach to our meetings, where I’m in reactive mode to what Ann is thinking about, and she sets the stage for me to help her in the best way possible,” she said. “When you make the transition to the post-grad world, you see more of what the world is about, and it’s important to take an exploratory approach there, too.”

This is the third and final edition of [my series](index-119.html) about Morehead-Cain Mentors based in Washington, D.C. For the [second piece](index-112.html), I spoke with David von Storch ’80.

# Morehead-Cain Mentor David von Storch ’80: ‘Experiencing failure frees you up to succeed’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

David von Storch ’80

Written by Cate Miller ’25, Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team

When Morehead-Cain asked David von Storch ’80 to serve as a mentor, he gave an immediate and enthusiastic “yes.” David had never participated in a mentoring program and didn’t quite know what to expect, but he wanted to “contribute to the next generation of scholars,” he said.

“Mentoring became a meaningful way for me to give back to the Foundation, which has given me so many opportunities and connections I wouldn’t have had otherwise,” David said. The alumnus is the CEO and founder of [Urban Adventures Companies, Inc.,](https://uacompanies.com/) in Washington, D.C.

The Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program paired David with Hunter Vaughan ’24, a double major in business administration and public policy at Carolina. The scholar said he was interested in signing up to gain wisdom and advice for what comes next after college.

“It’s been great to hear about David’s career journey, the topics he’s passionate about, and connect lessons from his entrepreneurial journey,” said Hunter, an incoming business analyst at McKinsey & Company in D.C. Outside of planning for post-graduation, the two have talked about graduate school, fitness, and ways to optimize the last few months on campus.

“I’m also interested in what it takes to start a business, and he has deep experience in that area,” Hunter said.

The pair have discussed ideas behind successful ventures and the logistics of building a startup. Other common themes have been preparing for pivots and failure, according to David.

“I’ve told Hunter that if you can get your hands around what failure looks like during your endeavors, you’ll be okay because experiencing failure frees you up to succeed,” the mentor said.

David has encouraged Hunter to be comfortable with not knowing what his career trajectory will look like, and to prioritize fostering a “trustworthy support system” of people you can rely on.

“It’s normal to not know your passion, calling, or your ‘why’ when you’re twenty-one years old. For me, it took until my mid-forties to look around and feel like this is where I belong professionally,” the entrepreneur said.

He said pouring into a scholar has been an affirming experience, particularly given the shared affinities for the Program and University.

“For alumni considering mentoring: you should realize that you’re a part of a very special group of people, you have skills and experience to share, and there’s value in all of that,” he said. “Why not embrace and share that with the next generation?”

This is the second edition of my three-part [series](index-119.html) about Morehead-Cain Mentors based in Washington, D.C. For the final edition, I spoke with [Andrea Stumpf ’84](index-111.html).

## Episode Transcription

(Aayas)

*It’s 1:24 a.m., and I am standing outside my tent on the world’s highest glacier. On Everest, you only get one weather window a year to attempt to climb, and I was just told it opened up an hour ago.*

*In front of me on the icefall, I see tiny specks of light moving up. Originating from all corners of the planet, after years of preparation, these specs emanate from the headlamps of the most determined people in the world.*

*Earlier this evening, I met climbers fundraising for disability awareness, for victims of war, advocates bridging racial gaps in mountaineering, climate scientists, documentary teams, and those pushing the known limits of the human body.*

*Base camp is a congregation of the most inspiring people and the most fascinating stories. It’s no wonder I’ve been standing here absolutely mesmerized. I’m in disbelief of where I am, atop a shifting glacier, standing taller than entire continents, next to a lake of clouds shrouding the valley below us, and surrounded by towering peaks glistening next to a rising moon.*

*Just me, my camera, and the captivating stillness of a night in the Himalayas.*

(Olu)

*Two vans to my left. They pull off. Seven lions in front of me. Click, click, click. One hundred photos, 30 minutes, one place. The first lion goes down, the second goes down, the third goes down, and the fourth follows. Edwin says, “A hunt is about to occur.” We take off, the wind brushing our face. The binoculars out. We’re following. Turn left. 1.5 kilometers later, we reach the spot. Boom. The lioness strikes a baby buffalo under the brush. The three lionesses follow. They arrive at the scene. Everyone in the van shocked. The male lion approaches the scene, takes the baby buffalo. The lioness is pushed against our van. We’re all frozen. Click, click, click.*

(Elias)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Elias Guedira, from the class of 2026. Joining us today are Aayas Joshi and Olu Kopano from the class of 2026. The two scholars went on an international gap year through Morehead-Cain. Aayas and Olu share their discoveries and reflections from their time abroad, as well as advice for incoming scholars.*

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining the podcast today.*

(Aayas)

*Thank you.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us on here.*

(Elias)

*For our listeners, Aayas and Olu are both wrapping up their first semester at UNC after taking a gap year through Morehead-Cain’s International Gap Year program. Olu graduated from St. Paul’s School in Baltimore, Maryland, while Aayas graduated from United World College in Changshu, China. Fun fact about Aayas, he is actually the first Morehead-Cain scholar from Nepal. Olu and Aayas, I hope you’ve had a smooth time adapting to life back here in the classroom, but also sufficient time to reflect on your gap year experiences. How does it feel to be back in a traditional learning environment?*

(Olu)

*It feels good. I had a magnificent year, probably the year where I was able to have the most and do the most learning that I’ve done in my life. But near the end of it, I was ready to be back in the school setting. And that school setting looks different now than what it would have pre-gap year. Pre-gap year, I was thinking business, minor in Japanese, and neither of those are in the equation now. Global studies, most likely, and pursuing Spanish, and it’s exactly what I want. I’m taking classes I’m passionate about and have found a direction that I like.*

(Elias)

*Nice.*

(Aayas)

*For me, coming back to conventional education, traditional education, has been interesting. I feel like my gap year prepared me for leaving home and the subtle chaos that is the first semester of college, but also because my gap year helped me decide what path I wanted to take for college, similar to what Olu was saying. And so what I’m studying now feels a little more intentional because I can connect it with what I learned on my gap year.*

(Elias)

*It’s so incredible being able to gain that experience, especially before going into college, really getting to explore the world outside of it before delving into it. So, thank you again for being on the podcast. So, flashback to March 2021. You’re looking at your computer or phone, or mobile device, and you learn that you’ve just received the Morehead-Cain scholarship. What prompts you to say, “Hey, I’m going to press a pause button on my college education and take a gap year for now?”*

(Olu)

*It was the idea that I have loved travel. I was able to travel to Tokyo in high school, had such a memorable experience, and I was missing that feeling. I had opportunities to travel later in high school, but COVID-19 hit, and that ended all possibility of that. So thinking of going into another year of schooling and missing out on the travel that I potentially could have had, just like I’d missed out in the past, was just an opportunity that I felt like I couldn’t miss again, especially when Morehead was funding a significant part of it.*

(Aayas)

*For me, I went to an international school, and so what happened was after they initially sent us back home for COVID, they weren’t able to bring us back. And so, I had gone through one and a half years of online school and was feeling pretty burned out by that point. And I’ve also always believed that the way that the system works right now tends to rush kids into choosing their life’s path of like 17, 18 years old when they haven’t really had a chance to explore what they really want to do. And so, I really liked the idea of taking a pause and exploring my interests in trying to find out what I want to pursue for college.*

*And I think what ended up prompting me to actually take the gap year was, ironically, the Catalyze podcast. I remember, I was listening to the gap year episode before this one, and it was Taylor’s voice—Taylor Shinal, class of ’25—and she was talking about her experience in the Serengeti, watching The Great Migration. And I remember listening to that at home and, like, pacing around my room saying, “I need to do this. This is exciting.”*

(Olu)

*Now that you mentioned that, it was honestly, I can vividly remember the time when I heard the Catalyze podcast on the gap year. And I went, I was sitting on the couch with my dad, and we were listening to it, and we both gave each other the same look and said, “You’re going to do this, you’re going to take this gap year.” And here I am.*

(Elias)

*Yeah, this is a full two years later. It’s such an incredible feeling. I mean, I was also in that same position, having taken a gap year myself, and I remember listening to this podcast and thinking, “Wow, what they did was super cool.” And the fact that we all get to be on the other side of it is such a treat. So a lot of people ended up taking gap years during COVID. Did you have any concerns that this was the wrong path initially? And what would you have to say to anybody that’s taking a gap year right now and might feel a little bit lost?*

(Olu)

*I don’t know if I had any concerns that it was the wrong path, but it is not just one path. It is an experience that is up to you to decide. And that’s scary. That is something that people don’t like. That’s something at one point that I was scared of. I had done all this research, and it led to nothing. And I thought, “What is this gap year going to be? What am I going to do? I have no clue what it’s going to look like.”*

*I was getting frustrated with myself. It was a difficult period, but it was ultimately one of the most rewarding periods of my life because I was, for the first time, had the power to decide what I was going to do with my life for a complete year.*

*So for people in this position now and struggling with what they might potentially do for the second half of the gap year, or if they’re thinking about it in the future, I would say lean into that discomfort because the other side will be better.*

(Elias)

*So if you were to condense your gap year travels into a storybook with chapters, what would you entitle each of those chapters, and what would the setting have been for each of them?*

(Olu)

*That’s a really good question. So I think this kind of goes off my last answer, and the first part was about diving in. So I would label the first chapter, which was Costa Rica, “Diving.” And that was diving into a language that I was unfamiliar with, diving into a culture and area that I was unfamiliar with, and diving into a project, which was construction, and building homes for single mothers, which obviously I had not done construction before. So everything was new. Everything was diving full force into it. And that was probably the first chapter.*

*And the second chapter would be “Solo.” Solo was in Saint Lucia. It was just me there. I was working an internship, and I didn’t know anybody. I had one family member, but other than that, that was it. And my nights were spent by myself. Most of my days were spent by myself. And that period was so important to the growth that I was able to develop later.*

*And the third chapter would be “Homecoming.” Homecoming because I was in Africa in that period. I traveled to Tanzania, Egypt, and Morocco. And even though I’d never been to Africa, my family, me, all of us included, we’ve always felt connected to Africa in some sense or another. And being able to actually step foot on the motherland was really important to me. And really, it felt like I was at home.*

*And I guess the last chapter would just be maybe “Jump Around.” I was in Europe, and I went to seven different countries. I stayed in Spain for six weeks, and then the other six were five days here, five days there. And each chapter was very pivotal in the gap year.*

(Aayas)

*My chapters would be slightly different. I think the first chapter I would call, “Hey, why don’t we go to Everest?” Fun little hike. So I had lived in Nepal for 18, 19 years, and I had never seen Mount Everest. So I told a group of friends, “Why don’t we go hiking and go see it?” And so that was the first chapter.*

*The second chapter I would call, “Oops, I accidentally hitchhiked the entire South Asian coast” because that was not the intention when I left home. I left on a fairly spontaneous international flight to New Delhi, and I happened to travel for almost two months, over 8,000 miles, 26 cities, around the entire South Asian coastline. So that was really fun.*

*Chapter three would probably be “Returned to Everest for a cause.” So that’s when I started to work on climate change projects in the region.*

*And the fourth project would be, I’d probably call it “The heritage project.” So for context, in 2015, Nepal faced a mega earthquake that flattened half of my city. And so a big debate that was sparked after that was, how do we preserve and document heritage so that we don’t lose it again? And I worked with a professor at UNC actually, a religious studies professor at UNC, on documenting tangible and intangible heritage 3D models, things like that. So that was a really cool project that I worked on, but those would be my four chapters.*

(Elias)

*So when you say documenting tangible and intangible artifacts, what exactly do you mean by that?*

(Aayas)

*It was really cool, actually. We had a team of people, and we would fly LiDAR drones around heritage sites to then 3D model them later. And the goal was to be able to create a virtual space where you can access this heritage and also have annotated stories and pictures and ways to explore the area without actually being there, so that if another earthquake does come and destroys the heritage, there’s still a replica or a version of it that we can still visit later.*

(Elias)

*Aayas, for viewers that are unfamiliar with your line of work, you spend a lot of time documenting monuments, documenting stories through photography, storytelling, and blogging. In fact, you’re working on a project with the goal of helping integrate Himalayan communities into scientific research and documenting the effects of global warming on these communities to spread awareness. Can you talk a little bit more about how you got involved with this project during your gap year?*

(Aayas)

*The first time I went to Everest Base Camp, I was amazed by how beautiful it is and all of that. But I was also very shocked by how many concerning things I saw that I had not heard about or I don’t think people generally knew about.*

*I remember this specific moment when I was walking on a glacier, the world’s highest glacier; it’s called the Khumbu Glacier. It was at 5,500 meters in elevation, that’s approximately 18 \[thousand\] feet, I believe. And we were walking on a solid glacier, and my foot went into the glacier, so it went into a meltwater pond. And my guide then was shocked and surprised, and he kept saying, “That’s not supposed to happen. This is not supposed to be melting. These puddles weren’t here last week.” And that got me really concerned. That experience is something I couldn’t forget even after I went back.*

*And so I started doing some research, and I started seeing these really concerning headlines, things along the lines of, the region is warming three times faster than the global average, or Everest alone has lost more than 2,000 years’ worth of ice and snow in the last 30 years, and how climate change in the region is expected to impact 1.5 billion people in South Asia. That’s one in every four humans. And so, after hearing all of that and realizing that not a lot of people knew about it, I thought that I wanted to do something. But at the time, I didn’t really know what I could do other than spread the word. So I tabled it for some time, and then I went on my India trip, and this thought of “I should do something” kept bothering me. I couldn’t let it go.*

*Coincidentally, after my India trip, I had other international plans that, because of visa issues, passport issues, or generally COVID restrictions, I had to cancel. And so I took that as a sign that I should go back to Everest. And I told myself, I’m going back. This time I’m going to take my filming gear with me, and I’m going to try to document what I saw and share it with others because maybe if people saw what I saw, maybe if people heard the stories that I heard, they would want to know more about the issue. They would care about it. And so that was the goal.*

*And before I went, I went on the Morehead-Cain Network, and I found Noam Argov. She’s the class of 2015. She’s a documentary filmmaker. So I sent her an email saying, “Hey, I really want to work on this. Do you know it? Do you have any advice, any wisdom for me?” (Hey, Noam, if you’re listening to this, very grateful to you.) But she linked me with this nonprofit called Himalayan Climate and Science Institute, and with them, I was able to work on projects integrating local communities with scientific research.*

*So the project that they were working on aimed to train local community members there to work on weather stations so that we don’t have to, like, fly out technicians and scientists from the other side of the world, which would speed up the data collection process quite a lot.*

(Elias)

*It’s so wonderful that you were able to capture the effects, the disproportional effects that climate change really has on people, especially in communities where people may feel unheard or not linked to media or scientific research. So I’d like to applaud you for all the great work that you’re doing there.*

*Olu, you entitled the portion of your gap year that you spent in Saint Lucia “Solo.” From my understanding, you spent a significant amount of time alone when you were working in Saint Lucia. You frequently mention that you had realizations while you were staying in the country, while you were spending nights and days by yourself. Can you share with listeners what you found to be the value of being alone and any discoveries you had about yourself or the environment?*

(Olu)

*First, being alone, I think the biggest discovery was surrounding learning, and I think I hinted at it earlier where I said the gap year was the year that I felt like I’d done the most learning ever in my life. And I really think that started in Saint Lucia. I honestly wasn’t the most excited as I was when I was going to Tanzania and Spain when it came to Saint Lucia, because I was alone, and I had not been alone for a significant period of time. Even when I was in Costa Rica, I joined a program, I was with a ton of people my age. But now I had an internship with middle-aged individuals, and then I was back in, just me, and that was scary.*

*So I wasn’t really the most excited for it. But again, I leaned into it, and it paid off. I had time to think about, just self-reflect. I had time to engage in different podcasts. I had time to start my Spanish learning and picking up Quizlet. I had time to read. And just by being alone, I learned more about myself. I found interests that I didn’t know I had.*

*And one more thing. Going off of the second part that you had about learning about the environment around me, I think this actually wasn’t done alone, but having that kind of experience where I was more tuned in to the place that I was working and place I was living. I definitely think I had some of those experiences.*

*So one, really quickly, would be working in concierge at a five-star resort. I was surrounded by other employees from Saint Lucia, and Saint Lucia, for those who don’t know, was colonized by the French and by the British, and it was a seven-time colonized by the French and eight-time by the U.K. And just looking at the effects that it had on how people were treated was very, very present. So a lot of folks from the U.K. would go to Saint Lucia for holiday, and I could see instantly the dynamic where the treatment was still from some sort of colonial approach, where, whether it was a demeaning tone or a place of “I’m better than you,” and it was really interesting to just be on the outside of that.*

*And yes, I looked like the Saint Lucians, but when I was approached, and when I was talking with guests, I could instantly see the difference because I didn’t have that St. Lucian background, and maybe having that time reflecting, being in that place where I was learning and creating and exploring my identity as well, I was able to see that in a different lens.*

(Elias)

*It’s so interesting being able to dive into that environment, especially from an American perspective. You kind of get to see the effects that colonialism and systemic injustices have on other countries and how your experience differs vastly from other people’s just because of your nationality.*

*Now, Olu, you mentioned doing a lot of things that you seem to appreciate more while you were alone. For me, I love to channel my thoughts through journaling and blogging. I also spent a considerable amount of time on Duolingo improving my languages. How did you go about expressing yourself, whether that was through journaling or storytelling among friends and family?*

(Olu)

*Journaling was definitely number one. I looked back at it the other day, actually, at my gap year journal, and I had over 60,000 words, I had around 100 pages of journaling, and whether it was only a few sentences a day or two pages a day, and that was more for me. That was more of the self-reflection. That was more of seeing the growth that I had from the beginning of the gap year to the end.*

*But I also had other forms, whether it was my Instagram and keeping people engaged with photos and stories, or whether it was just through photography. For example, in Tanzania, when we were there, actually, during the Serengeti trip, I was able to take over 1.200—1,300 photos and videos, and I still have them as my screensavers today. And just, that being a reminder of what is out there in the world and seeing incredible sites, Ngorongoro Crater, lions hunts, and elephants. And knowing that that can happen, and I lived that, and I look forward to doing something like that. And again, and obviously, that’s all thanks to Morehead, the Morehead-Cain funding that I was able to receive from them.*

(Elias)

*Wonderful. And you, Aayas?*

(Aayas)

*For me, I must say, Elias, it was actually you that inspired me to start documenting more. I remember in the beginning of the year when you and Spence took that road trip across North America, and you had a blog, and you were posting pictures. I remember looking at it and going, “That is so cool. I want to start doing more of that, too, like documenting more of my journeys.”*

*And so I’ve always loved photography. And so when I went trekking, when I went on my different gap year trips, I started taking pictures and posting little story blogs and story sessions on Instagram, and that’s where most of my documenting happened. Personally, I also journaled quite a bit. I had an online journal that has thousands and thousands of words. It’s always nice to look back at some of them and see a year ago I was here doing this.*

(Elias)

*I feel so honored that I inspired you to take a blogging and photography, and I also have to respect you for what you have done with it and how you have gone about documenting your gap year. I have always admired that.*

(Aayas)

Thank you, Elias.

(Elias)

*Okay, this is a tough question. What is your favorite memory from your gap year?*

(Olu)

*I often tell people, I kind of break it up into experiences, and I might cheat a little bit with this question.*

*My favorite experience was the, I think it was seven of us in Tanzania and the Serengeti trip that we had, a seven day experience where we’re living out in tents and we’re hearing hyenas right behind us while we’re trying to sleep, and we’re waking up to elephants tearing down trees. That would probably be my favorite experience.*

*And my favorite trip would be you and me, actually, in Morocco, eight days where were in Rabat, we’re in Marrakesh, and we take a three-day, two-night trip to the Sahara, and we’re riding camels into the sunset and going to sleep in the Sahara and waking up and sand boarding through the dunes. And I would probably say those two experiences were the most memorable and my favorite memories, for sure.*

(Aayas)

*One of my favorite experiences that was actually recurring throughout my gap year was seeing the Milky Way.*

*So I love stargazing, personally, and so to be able to see the Milky Way in the sky from different places: one, from Everest Base Camp when I was surrounded by the glistening peaks, the world’s highest mountains towering over me. Seeing the Milky Way on the night that I bivvied in the Thar Desert—it’s in northwest India. The day that we found an oasis and slept next to it.*

*Seeing the Milky Way from the backwaters of Kerala in a tropical rainforest, and then seeing the Milky Way next to bioluminescent waves on the southernmost tip of South India. That would probably be my favorite experience for my gap year, seeing the same thing across these different places.*

(Elias)

*I know there’s so many things to choose from, and personally, I cannot pick one single favorite memory from the gap year. I think they’re all special in their own ways. My final question for you, if you could give one piece of advice to your pre-gap year self, what would that piece of advice be?*

(Olu)

*Don’t make a plan. That might not be the advice that I should be giving right now, but I think the most important experiences that I had in my gap year weren’t planned. They were made by mistake. They happened because my plan fell through, and I had to come up with something different.*

*I think having that flexibility to find an interest and be in a country, and then that spark an idea of what to do next, where to go next, that would be what I say to do. Don’t have a plan. Don’t create a whole year of what you think you’re going to do because you won’t do it. Lean into the unknown and stick with it.*

(Aayas)

*I really agree with that, Olu. My advice to myself would be very similar. The best place for you is where you naturally gravitate to and not necessarily the path you carve out for yourself.*

*I know you guys know this, Olu and Elias, but for the listeners, prior to going on my gap year trips, I thought Morehead-Cain was really strict with what they wanted me to do and how I could use their stipend. So I produced an 83-page PDF of my gap year plan. I planned every single day. It had maps, it had color-coded calendars, and I ended up doing almost none of that.*

*I’m very glad that it worked out that way, because I would not trade the experiences I had on my gap year for anything.*

(Elias)

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining Catalyze today.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us. It was a pleasure.*

(Elias)

*Thank you for joining Catalyze. I’m Elias Guedira from the class of 2026, and that was Olu Kapano and Aayas Joshi from the class of 2026. You can let us know what you thought of the episode by emailing us at communications@moreheadcain.org or by following us on Twitter or Instagram at @moreheadcain.*

(Abbey Beebe ’27)

*Hello, everyone. This is Abbey Beebe.*

*I am a current gap year scholar, and right now, I’m on an island off the coast of Honduras called Utila, and it’s about 9:52 p.m., and I just jumped into the Caribbean Sea.*

*And I want you to picture every time you move a limb, so you kick or you move your arm, the ocean lights up like a galaxy full of stars. And this is because of the bioluminescence.*

*And it’s truly a magical experience. And it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. And I’m just lucky to be here.*

(Elias)

*It’s mid-October. The sun shines, golden. Transparent, deep blue sky colliding with gleaming sands in the horizon. I look at the point of earth stretching highest to the sun, Erg Chebbi, the tallest dune in Morocco, and among those in the Sahara Desert. An unforeseen impulse rises in me, screaming in me, telling me to climb.*

*I call out to my friend from Arabic class. She wears an orange and black caftan and a scarf, protecting her vision from the sun’s piercing rays. She looks on from a nearby ridge, observing like a tiger. I let her know it could take a while before I come down.*

*I dig my foot into the mountain before me and begin. Grains of sand sift beneath my toes while an hourglass sifts above my head. The sun above me encroaches the earth. As I wear a blue jillaba, I fight its fabric clawing at my feet, holding my movement as I climb. Suddenly, the sand loses grip of the mountain it’s clinging to. The sound of friction as the particles slide. I lose my footing. Now, futilely, I’m stretching my feet and arms into the only surface I can see in front of me.*

*I breathe. Regain control. The sun pulls closer. As I ascend, I hear voices in another language. Blurs of movement behind heat waves. Two tourists enjoying their first days in Morocco. We trade names and stories. We appreciate two vastly different views.*

*I look back to my friend. Behind her neck, tents and base camp. And then, the Hamada. A barren expanse of rock desert. Shale floating on eerily still sand like melting ice on the surface of a lake. Shards of rock cracking and drifting apart. Black mountains fold upward in the distance, indicating the last frontier before Algeria.*

*I turn around towards the sun setting in front of me, an ocean of sand. Waves arcing in every direction, formations that must have been caused by some sort of tempest. Below, at the horizon, riders on camelbacks piercing their way through the rolling dunes like ships in a storm. I stay here for a moment, admiring the stillness from above. Breeze blows from the west. The sun meets earth and back into the quiet storm. I descend.*

(Chandler Beals ’27)

*Hello, everyone.*

*My name is Chandler Beals, and I am a current gap year scholar. And right now, I’m sitting at the Las Vegas airport. I have a layover here on my way home from Baja California Sur, Mexico, where I did the Baja Sea Kayaking course through the National Outdoor Leadership School, NOLS.*

*Yes, I just had a really mediocre panini, and I’m sitting here with my iced coffee, just kind of people watching and reflecting on my trip. I feel very content, very thankful, and also a little sad. It’s hard to live with people for an entire month and really get to know them well, and then, just as quickly as you came, have to leave them behind.*

*With traveling a lot, I feel like my heart’s in a lot of different places, but at the same time, it’s a really good feeling. And, yeah, I leave for Sweden in a week, and I’m really happy to be here.*

### Episode Transcription

(Benny)

*Mr. McCain, thank you so much for coming onto the podcast.*

(Wendell)

*It’s my pleasure, Benny. Thanks for having me.*

(Benny)

*Of course. So, for those who don’t know, Mr. McCain is actually the dad of my best friend, Davis. So, I’ve gotten to know him pretty well over the years.*

(Wendell)

*I’ve cooked a lot of pancakes for Benny.*

(Benny)

*Cooked a lot of breakfast, that’s for sure. The world famous crunchy french toast. That’s right. If you’ve ever spent any time around the McCains, you know how special their family is and why I’m so excited that Mr. McCain agreed to be my first guest. Mr. McCain, I’d love to start out talking about your dad, who obviously was a pioneer in the civil rights movement.*

*Could you just talk a little bit about what it was like growing up with him as your father, you and your brothers, and maybe something that has gotten left out of the narrative after all the media coverage and fame that it’s brought, just what’s one thing that you feel isn’t included as well?*

(Wendell)

*That’s a great question. I’m going to take that one at the end. But I would say, growing up, there was a tremendous—from the time that I could understand inequality and from the time that I could understand, sort of, being an activist—it was something that my father impressed upon all of us: that it was a right, a privilege, and an expectation that we contribute. And along the lines of social activism and particularly the focus or at least one area that all of us focused on, is really kind of trying to be a voice for those who, communities that have been marginalized or disenfranchised.*

*And so this notion of—I laugh sometimes today because—this notion of social equity and racial equity is nothing new to our family. It’s something that has been the core of our being from the time that we could even have some idea of what that all meant. What I would say, you asked me something that maybe most people don’t think or know about my father was that, oddly enough, he was physically an imposing figure who’s 6’ 4” and about 400 pounds and had a big voice. And my dad was a very intense guy, but inside particularly was a teddy bear at certain points in times, at the right times, I would argue, and I don’t think most people would have really thought that about him. Most people didn’t see necessarily the super soft side, and I’m sure that was intentional, but he was a great father.*

(Benny)

*Could you also talk a little bit about your mom, who gets a little less of the spotlight, but I’d love to know what she was like.*

(Wendell)

*Yeah, my mother was a fantastic woman, an incredibly strong woman—grew up in a family where she had four big men, and she was a lone wolf woman in our family. But oftentimes, she could carry the biggest stick. With that being said, she truly was my dad’s partner. She didn’t walk in front, she didn’t walk behind; she walked beside him. And they met in college, and she really mobilized the women from Bennett College with my dad and his three buddies, started the sit-ins movement. And she was an educator.*

*And one big thing in our family, education was a big deal. The thing that we’re proud of is a history of education. Very unusual. Grandparents and great grandparents in the South, African Americans who were college educated, which was really unusual. So going to college was like going to first grade, as far as my family was concerned. Can’t even call it an expectation. It was kind of, “Of course you are, right?”*

*But my mother was a librarian initially and then taught high school English. And then she took over as a really big role as head of all of staff and curriculum for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system and then later finished her career as a principal in an elementary school. And the one thing I’d say, she loved kids, wasn’t out of the ordinary for us to come home and find three random kids that we’d never seen in our lives at our dinner table, having dinner with us. And it wasn’t random that there were times when I went into my closet, and clothes were missing because my mother had given my clothes away to kids at our school that needed clothes. But she was very passionate about kids and was an avid reader and probably read seven to eight books a week and would go to bed at 2:30 and 3:00 and be up at 6:30 to make breakfast for us. And she did that for 20 plus years. So, high energy woman and big reader and very compassionate and loved kids.*

(Benny)

*Fantastic. You read seven to eight books a week, too, right?*

(Wendell)

*Only in my dreams.*

(Benny)

*You and me both. Could you mention just a moment where obviously maybe not a burden is the right word, but it’s a lot to take in. When did it become real for you? Are there moments?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah, I’ll give you one of those moments where you kind of get that gut punch about how big and how expectations are great. Consider my family heritage. Barbara Walters, who maybe as I was teasing you at one point, maybe generational gap was the equivalent of an Oprah Winfrey today, right?*

(Benny)

*Got it.*

(Wendell)

*And she came to our house and did an interview with my father, and my whole family was seated around my dad. And at the end of the interview, she asked my older brother and I a question. I was probably about eleven, and my older brother is four years my senior. She asked him what his favorite hobby was, and he said that we’re all big swimmers. You wouldn’t know by our physique today that we used to be swimmers. And then she looked at me, and I was probably about eleven, and she said, “Well, Wendell, your father changed the course of American history and the course of the world. What are you going to do?” And I was just saying to myself, “Well, that’s great. You gave my brother the powder-puff question, and you laid the weight of the world on my shoulders.” And I said to her, “Well, I’m going to start off by graduating high school and then college, and then I’ll take it from there. How about that?”*

*But that moment was certainly a moment where I felt the expectation of weight, in terms of what people thought, that I had a responsibility to contribute and to continue our family’s legacy. But throughout my life, I haven’t viewed it as a burden. I’ve viewed it as a challenge and a responsibility. And so I think that has kept me from what others may—weight can be suffocating, right? And so I think you have to really position it a little differently. And I think to me, it’s responsibility more than weight.*

(Benny)

*One of those the questions that I had and one of the reasons why I wanted to start the podcast is that question that she asked you, is: what are you going to do to change the world? It feels grand and it definitely is a grand question, so I’d love to hear a little bit more about how you got to where you are now. What was applying to college like out of North Mecklenburg High?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah.*

(Benny)

*What was the decision to become a Morehead? I know you were interested in the ivy leagues and decided to come to Chapel Hill. What was that like?*

(Wendell)

*I remember distinctly, my dad spoke, and I accompanied him on the campus of Princeton when I was in middle school. And I went there, and I fell in love with just like—I love history and the history of Princeton, and the beauty of the architecture of the school. From that moment, I was like, “This is where I want to go to college,” and was fortunate enough to be accepted. And at the time, going to Carolina almost felt like a continuation of high school in the sense that I knew a lot of people going, and for a big part of my life prior to that, I’ve always been adventurous.*

*So I had the chance to travel a lot, probably by the time I was in high school, I’d been to 40, 50 countries. And so, going to Carolina at that time felt like, “Oh, man, this is not the window going, stepping out, doing something different, seeking something completely different than what I’ve known.” And what was really the deciding factor was the feeling that I had Finals Weekend, the culture of the Morehead family, and really, the summer internships. And that was the thing to me that I thought would be a differentiator, not just in my life experience, but also post-college and making the transition to the working world. That resume reads very differently. A lot of kids go to Princeton, right? But at the time, the Morehead scholarship was distinctively different than anything else in the country. And that was a huge draw for me. And the Carolina experience was an amazing one.*

(Benny)

*What was Chapel Hill like for you? What were you interested in studying? Did you know that you wanted to go into economics, or was that a longer decision?*

(Wendell)

*No, I didn’t. I had gotten advice not to study business as an undergraduate major. Okay, you can argue the virtues, right or wrong. And so economics was the best proxy that I thought that something was close to business, but that was probably not as focused as maybe a business major would be. So that’s kind of how I ended up in econ, and I had a minor in African studies and in geology. And I’m sure you can see the connection. Yes, I know you can probably see the connection between all of those. And if you can, then you deserve this week’s award and next week’s award. But I loved it. I had a great experience in the econ department, and my favorite professors were Sandy Darity, which I did a senior sort of thesis with him, and he’s unfortunately joined the evil empire 8 miles away. But I tell him I forgive him. And Dr. Watt and Dr. Goldman were fantastic professors who really, I think, were challenging but fair, and I learned a lot from them.*

(Benny)

*So you study econ; you have a great time in Chapel Hill. Then comes the big decision that I’m worried about, and a lot of my friends are, is what do you do next? So how do you decide to go into finance and feel confident in that decision?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah, so for me—and it’s a conversation, I would say—I was very pragmatic in the sense that this whole notion of: how do I contribute and have the maximum impact? And so I’ve always been a believer in scale and everything from business to the impact I want to make on the world. And for me, that means minimally, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, right. And so, before my father died, I said, “Look, I think the modern day civil rights movement is economic liberation.” And when I started really studying, how do you liberate people economically? Undoubtedly, it always seems to lead back to who either controls capital or who allocates capital. And so for me, a career in finance was a mechanism for me to understand how capital allocation decisions get made, how people generate capital and create wealth. That was the driver for me to choose a career in finance.*

*And when I looked across the landscape, what was incredibly disappointing and only underlined and highlighted that it was the route to go was the lack of diversity in financial services. And I saw that, and I said, “How can you understand the system of capitalism and/or make a difference if there’s not significant representation from all communities, and in this case, the minority community?” And so I knew and later realized that, unfortunately, getting a chair in the industry: it is clubby. It is not a level playing field. We have a long, long way to go. And the reason it’s clubby is because the reality is that the people in the circle realize that in order to maintain power and the power structure, you want to be selective about who you let in. And if you’re really happy with the way things have gone on forever and a day, the last thing you want to do is to bring people in the circle who might change the way things happen. And so I understood that. I think maybe one of the very few smart things I’ve done in my life. But I understood that early on that the change was going to have to come as a function of being a part of the circle, not outside of the circle. On that front, I decided there was a program called Inroads that still exists today. And it was really focused on helping high school seniors secure a four-year internship. And those internships would happen over the summers, starting with the summer prior to freshman year and then going through the summer prior to your senior year in college. And so the process was simple. You interviewed with several companies, companies would make you offers, and then you’d decide which company you wanted to go to, and then you’d do four rotations over the summers in that one company. And so my sponsoring company was a little bank called NCNB, North Carolina National Bank, which became Nations Bank and later became Bank of America. And I had the good fortune of having Hugh McColl, who was the CEO, as my mentor. And the bank grew from a billion dollars to $100 billion in that four straight years.*

(Benny)

*You got hooked.*

(Wendell)

*Yeah, I did. I witnessed tremendous growth, and it solidified for me that I wanted to pursue a career in finance. And I knew for me that the Mecca of finance has always been Wall Street. And so I made that decision to not take the offer from the bank after college, which was a tough thing to go tell Mr. McColl, who had mentored me for four years, and he was a five foot seven Marine who was a really tough guy. And I wasn’t sure what his response was going to be to my decision, but he couldn’t have been more of a prince and encouraged me to go to Wall Street and said, “Look, I’m happy to make a spot for you when you’re ready to come back home.” So, I never came back home, but I did have a great experience in Wall Street, and it’s a place where I would tell you you mature and you grow up very quickly, amongst many other sort of fine attributes that you learn along the way.*

(Benny)

*I’d love to go down your path out of UNC now and talk a little bit about Wall Street. And there’s a lot of stereotypes, rumors, whatever you want to call it, about what the Wall Street culture is like. What was it like for you? And then, if you could just touch on a little bit your first couple of years out of college before Kellogg.*

(Wendell)

*So, I would tell you, one of the most difficult things I had to do early on was—as I mentioned, Mr. McColl was a tremendous mentor to me—and the hardest thing I had to do was walk into his office in my senior year and tell him that I wasn’t going to take the offer to stay with the bank and that I wanted to go to Wall Street. I wasn’t really sure how he was going to respond, but as he was and is a class act, he said, “Listen, I get it. Go to Wall Street, get the wiggly wigglies out of your pants, and then when you’re done, come on back home, and I’ll make some room for you wherever you want to go,” which was great. I didn’t ever come back, but he just was incredibly supportive.*

*So I chose interestingly, once again, a little bit of a different path. All my friends were, the two final offers that I was deciding between were JP Morgan and Lazard Freres. And Lazard was very different from most of your traditional financial analyst programs on the street. Most of those programs brought in 200 to 300 newly minted college graduates at Lazard, and the M & A group, there were eight of us. And the reason I ended up making that decision, interestingly enough, was Trey Loughran, who was a Morehead who was two years ahead of me, had gone to Lazard. And I had a great relationship with Trey through college. And Lazard was in a unique place. We only did really Fortune, sort of, 50 global M & A. And what was really different, that I didn’t fully appreciate when I decided to go, was that most Wall Street firms, if you’re in the way deals or staff, you have a managing director, you have a director, you have a vice president, you have an associate, you have an analyst. And that is what they’ll call a deal team, right? And at Lazard, sometimes it was a managing director and just an analyst.*

(Benny)

*But was it the same amount of wealth that you guys were dealing with, or is it smaller overall?*

(Wendell)

*Overall, it was a smaller, much smaller firm, but much bigger deals.*

(Benny)

*Were you ever questioning where the diversity, equity, and inclusion comes in at this point? And how did you kind of cope with that?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah, so I would tell you, it was really, for me, magnified. When I was at Lazard, Lazard was such a small place and interestingly, I worked with—the other thing about Lazar that was very unique is what I realized—I was even sort of a special case because of the eight members of my class, for example, one guy was the grandson of the former leader of France, \[Georges\] Pompidou. Another father was a multibillionaire who had a huge conglomerate spanning three continents. Another was an original descendant of the J. P. Morgan family. So I was kind of saying to myself, “I don’t understand why I’m here.” You know what I mean? But all that to say is that there was diversity from ethnicity, diversity from geographical upbringing, people born in different continents. And so, in the Lazard experience, not so much. But when I got to Lazard, I was on a trading floor. There were probably 600 people on that trading floor, and there were exactly three African Americans. And it was at that point that it was really clear that this place called Wall Street is far from being diverse. And with that, I was a unique case in the sense. And my boss told me on the first day, he said, “Well, somebody here really likes you. But just so you know, you’re the youngest person that we’ve ever allowed to be in this group ever in the history of the firm. And so my eyes are going to be on you, and if you screw up, you’re going to be out the door.” So that was my first indoctrination to my new group. And I couldn’t figure out whether someone was irritated because maybe someone who was older, they wanted to . . .*

(Benny)

*How old were you?*

(Wendell)

*I was 24, 24. So I didn’t know whether it was because they wanted someone of their friends to have that chair, or whether it was because of the way I looked, or whether it was a combination of both, but it was definitely not the welcoming committee.*

(Benny)

*It sounds like, one thing that you mentioned earlier, is kind of a seat at the table or ability to see capital move capital and have a true influence. So I’m sure that being with French royalty and Morgan heirs and all of that, you quickly realize that you have access to make a difference. When does that sort of start?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah. So for me, I think it started early in the sense that I made very, the decisions I made were well-orchestrated in the sense that I knew that there were certain skills that I needed to make the biggest difference. And so every time I made a decision in my career, it was with the bigger picture in place, which is, how do I position myself to be in a place where I’m an allocator of capital or an investor? Because unfortunately, in the context of the US sort of business world, that he or she who controls the goal oftentimes controls the narrative, oftentimes controls the regulatory environment, oftentimes controls who becomes wealthy and who doesn’t, or makes the rules. And I don’t love it at all. But I know that you have a decision to make is to understand the way things operate.*

*And you can either put yourself in a position where you have influence, and that influence can lead to positive change. And there are many ways, not to say that capital and money is the only way to do that. But I think that I felt like as I looked across that trading floor and saw three people of color, that there weren’t many people who had the ability to access this channel. And so, as I said to my father before he died, that’s the thing. There’s lots of people that look like me that can go march in the streets. But unfortunately, there are fewer people who get access to have a venue or had access to be able to control capital that are of color. And so, given that I had the privilege of getting a chair, I had to make the most of that chair.*

(Benny)

*Great. Could you talk a little bit about how you transition from Wall Street, you end up in Chicago at Kellogg?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah. So I knew that it was important, just as I thought about sort of my career evolution, ability to kind of continue, get increasing responsibilities, and also, quite frankly, just witnessing and having a desire to pursue a career in private equity. The one thing—when you talk about lessons learned, Benny, and it didn’t take me long to figure this out—which I didn’t mention, I did it to appease my father and godfather: I did apply to law school and got into some good law schools but deferred and never went. But I knew I didn’t want to be a corporate lawyer after my one year at Lazard because I was leaving the office at 2:00, and then giving my attorneys my work product and having them turn it around between the hours of two and five. And I just said to myself, “I don’t think I want to be that guy. I don’t think I want to be that guy or that gal.” Now, with that being said, I also recognize that I worked 110 hours a week to create a work product for these quote unquote private equity guys who always seemed to be in a car on the way home at 4:00. But they made 20 times to 50 times the amount of money that I made. So I was like, this private equity thing is pretty interesting. Yeah, right, how do I find that track? I thought business school would be.*

*Business school is oftentimes, an MBA program is oftentimes an ability to transition or change direction or change industries. And I didn’t want to change industries, but I knew it would be critically important. The private equity and venture capital world is unfortunately still the club-iest of the club-y. Like I told people, it’s harder than getting in the MBA, I feel like sometimes. And so, I knew I had to have that stamp in order to have a shot. So in business school, I had the good fortune of having a classmate by the name of Charlie Gifford, whose father was the CEO of BankBoston. And we became really good friends. And one day I said to him after we went out for dinner and had a couple of drinks, and I said, “Charlie,” I said, “Everybody and their mother, I’m sure, has asked you, can you help get them an interview at the private equity arm of the bank?” And he said, “Yeah, everybody and their mother has asked me that.” And I said, “Okay.” He says, “But you’re the one person I’ll call for. And I’ll call my dad and see if he can at least get you an interview.” And so he was kind enough to do it. And the head of the private equity group talked to me on the phone, and he said, “Listen, I’ve never hired anybody except Tuck grads, and we’re not hiring anybody this year. But the CEO, who’s my boss, said he wanted me to take an interview with you, so if you want to fly to from Evanston to Boston, I’ll give you 20 minutes.” So I was thinking to myself, a whole 20 minutes, I’m going to spend four and a half hours on an airplane back and forth, 20 minutes for those 20 minutes. But I said, “Look, that’s my shot, and I got to take it.” And so I went for the interview, and that 20 minutes ended up turning into two and a half hours with him, which then turned into another 3 hours because he introduced me to other folks in the firm. And that night, he gave me an offer, and he said, “I want you. I want you here.” A lot of people would have said, “20 minutes, no way in hell. I’m good. No, thanks.” And I just said, “You know what? I got 20 minutes. How do I make the most of it?” And he ended up being a great mentor to me.*

*And for me, the reason I chose—it was so important for me to choose BankBoston versus other offers—was I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to be a venture capital guy, which would be investing in early stage companies. Sometimes a man and a woman have an idea scratched on a sheet of paper and say, “Hey, we need $200,000 to get started.” Right. Which was very fascinating to me because I like building things and helping people build companies, or a private equity professional, which really focuses on established businesses that are generating profits. And at the time, we were much more financial engineering, I would argue, and less company building. And so I didn’t know which of the two I would like more. But the beauty of BankBoston was, is that as a firm, we did all of those things.*

*So we did early stage venture capital and just an idea and writing the first check to get a company started to companies that were growing but not quite profitable to companies that had old economy companies, I would say, like manufacturers who have been around for 50 years and really mundane, but they generate profit every year steady. And then we invested in other fund groups. And so, I had the chance to do all of those things. And I was industry agnostic. So I’ve invested in healthcare, life sciences, MedTech devices, software, hardware, restaurants, manufacturers, distributors, pool cleaners, nurseries. And if you’re someone who’s intellectually curious, you get to meet some of the smartest people in many different fields. So I often tell people that I’m about six inches deep and about two miles wide on my knowledge of different industries. And my wife said with my weight the way it is, the two miles wide is becoming a literal thing. But that’s another story.*

(Benny)

*Could you talk a little bit about, not only in your role in OnSet Capital, but in other positions and boards that you’ve sat on, how you try and bring people up?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah. And look, I don’t place judgment. I love making money. But for me, making money has never been about stuff or the ability to acquire stuff. And look, does it mean that I don’t like nice things? Of course not. But what really drives me and what I have seen consistently from the time I can remember that if Wendell McCain has an ability to influence at scale. And at scale is really critical because I would argue everyone has an opportunity to be a force of good and change in their local communities or in their local circles. But for me, I’ve always wanted to do it at scale. And scale means impacting tens, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of lives. That’s what really drives me.*

*And so I know that if my net worth has an extra couple of zeros, you can argue and debate whether it’s right or wrong. But I have a bigger microphone, and I have a bigger ability to influence legislators who make the rules that impact the lives of tens of millions, of hundreds of millions of people in this country. So for me, that’s what drives me. Because I know the bigger the microphone that I have, the more I can challenge people to do the right thing. And the right thing is, look, I’m not suggesting that we necessarily, what I’m looking for is I want everyone to have an equal opportunity to be successful. And I think that’s good for America. I’m not advocating redistribution of wealth. I’m advocating giving everyone an equal opportunity to have their slice of the American dream. That’s what drives me.*

(Benny)

*Absolutely. There’s been a renewed or maybe even a new sense of focus on big business and diversity, donating or committing money to certain scholarships or different opportunities for people in minority communities. The summer before was a really loud summer. But how do you think it’s been as far as an impactful summer, or is the movement doing what your dad would hope it would?*

(Wendell)

*That’s a great question. I struggle with that because I think truthfully, it’s too early, too soon to tell. And what I mean by that is George Floyd wasn’t that long ago. And unfortunately—and maybe this is the difference between Benny at 20 and Wendell at 51—is that the beauty of young people, as my father would say, and I understand what he means by this statement, young people have unbridled optimism, and Benny would probably believe this is a chance, for the first time in this country, to have meaningful, sustainable change in the way that the people of color in this country are treated. And the optimistic Wendell, who by nature I am, would agree with you; the realistic Wendell would be very skeptical that this time is going to be any different. That the fad and fashion to say that we want to be progressive and try to address these issues is hot at the moment. But let’s see where we are in 24 months forward. And whether there’s substantive change. And I think that it takes a long time to change, unfortunately, some people’s behavior that has been created over many, many years. And so I always want to remain optimistic, but I always am a realist when it comes to what’s likely to happen. And I hope I’m wrong. It’s one of the few times you’ll hear me say I hope I’m wrong, you know what I mean?*

(Benny)

*I got to spend last summer in Minneapolis, which was an interesting place to be at an interesting time. And we got to speak with Jerry Blackwell a couple of weeks ago and hear his take on prosecuting Derek Chauvin, which was a great opportunity. He mentions the big, hairy, ugly goal. What are you writing on a piece of paper or sticky note and putting on your college dorm room? And that was his advice—is write something down, put it on the door, and look back at it a couple of times a week. But don’t worry too much, and it’ll come to you. It’ll happen. What would your advice be to maybe someone thinking about Wall Street or investment banking who’s stressed about it and burning hours in the library. What would you tell them now?*

(Wendell)

*Yeah, there are a couple of things I would say. You always have to strive for excellence, strive for excellence, and be passionate about what you do every day. Tomorrow is not promised to any of us. And so you really need to try to love what you do and to be the best at what you do. So I would start there. And I think the second component is to try to understand and figure out how you can be a force of change and pursue those things that you know that are right and good. And as my father would always tell us, that leadership, people sometimes forget, is that you have to be willing to stand alone, right. If you know it’s the right thing to do because if you’re waiting on the masses, they ain’t coming. You have to be willing to stand or sit and be comfortable that you may be by yourself for a while, but know that what you’re doing is bigger than the moment, it’s bigger than you. And you have to have that sort of unbridled passion and desire and fortitude to do that. And that’s leadership. And generally speaking, if you do it long enough, people will follow. But don’t expect it’s going to happen on day one. You be prepared for that, it may not happen on day 200. But that’s what leadership is about.*

(Benny)

*Yes, sir. Thank you so much for coming to talk. I like how you said you got to be willing to stand but okay to stand alone or sit alone. Thank you so much for coming on to talk to me.*

(Wendell)

*Benny, it was a pleasure, always a pleasure.*

(Benny)

*Yes, sir.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Three-part miniseries on sustainable farming in North Carolina, featuring Carolyn Roff Henry ’87 of Tryon Mountain Farms
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Stella Smolowitz ’26, Carolyn Roff Henry ’87, and Elias Guedira ’26 at Tryon Mountain Farms in Tryon, North Carolina

For Earth Day, we released a three-part miniseries on sustainable farming in North Carolina.

Elias Guedira ’26 and Stella Smolowitz ’26 of the Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team traveled to Tryon (Polk County) to understand more about the food we consume and those who produce it.

The two co-hosts spoke with representatives of a farmer’s market, the founder of a creamer, and Carolyn Roff Henry ’87 of [Tryon Mountain Farms](https://www.tryonmountainfarms.com/).

# Placing a premium on sustainability: Alex Lassiter ’10
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")
Alex Lassiter ’10 (courtesy of Alex Lassiter ’10)

*[This story was originally published via sustainable.unc.edu on April 18, 2023.](https://sustainable.unc.edu/news/2023/04/18/alex-lassiter-placing-a-premium-on-sustainability/)*

Condiment packets from your favorite fast food restaurants are notoriously un-recyclable.

On a recent episode of his company’s podcast, Alex Lassiter ’10 sat down with Missy Schapphok, a member of his advisory board. Together, they unpacked the challenges of flexible film packets. Schapphok, Taco Bell’s director of global nutrition and sustainability, explained how their [partnership with TerraCycle](https://www.tacobell.com/terracycle) sets them apart from others.

Lassiter, who founded startup [Green Places](https://greenplaces.com/) in 2021, loves to ask. Even talking with a representative of one of the largest food brand services in the world—[Taco Bell serves 42 million customers on any given week](https://www.tacobell.com/faq/our-purpose-planet)—doesn’t deter him from asking all the “why” questions.

“When you stay in a hotel or pick a restaurant, ask them what they do in regard to sustainability,” says Lassiter. “Even if they say, ‘we do nothing,’ asking means they’re going to flag it. If it’s not being asked, they’re not going to solve it.”

Founding Green Places

Through Green Places, Lassiter helps businesses solve their sustainability challenges. For many companies, taking the initial plunge is the biggest challenge.

“Companies don’t know what they’re supposed to be doing – it’s different for every industry,” says Lassiter. “People ask us where they should begin, what three things they should focus on first, and where they should go from there.”

In 2023, the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s published proposed rules](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/upcoming-sec-climate-disclosure-rules-bring-urgency-esg-data-strategy-planning-2023-01-30/) for greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting. This would require public companies to report GHG emissions, indirect emissions from electricity and other energy sources, and emissions from activities within its overall value chain. Essentially, tracking sustainability would become a requirement for companies.

Not only can Green Places’ platform track and analyze emissions data, but it can also identify solutions for companies. Lassiter explains that the software can pull data from a company’s properties, offices and/or locations to illustrate energy efficiency.

“If a business has $100 million to spend on capital upgrades, our software can help identify where to do that in a way that’s most environmentally beneficial,” says Lassiter. “We can show them what it would cost to fix a problem.”

The software also offers a sustainability and ESG policy library that allows businesses to identify gaps in their sustainability policies. In effect, Green Places not only serves as a “sustainability team” but also as a “consultant” for policy development.

Lassiter refers to sustainability as a 20-year challenge for businesses, explaining that it’s not something a business has to accomplish in the first year. He believes the most important part is taking that first step.

Traveling to Far Away Places

A self-described “non-adventurous kid,” Lassiter began his undergraduate journey in 2006. Tracing his career back to Carolina, Lassiter explains that back then, the world felt small in terms of career options.

Through [Morehead-Cain](https://www.moreheadcain.org/), Lassiter studied abroad in Prague, taught English in China, lived off the grid in the Wyoming mountains, and wrote his thesis on phone banking in South Africa. Turns out, being thrown into multiple adventures in a 4-year time span can really change your perspective on the world.

“Something happened at Carolina where I was really given this opportunity to get out there and it changed the trajectory of my life,” says Lassiter.

As one of the newest members of the [UNC-Chapel Hill Board of Visitors](https://bov.web.unc.edu/), Lassiter chairs the subcommittee on global relations. It’s a fitting, full-circle moment. He hopes to help the next generation of Tar Heels see the vastness and interconnectedness of our world.

On the Board of Visitors, Lassiter works closely with [Vice Provost for Global Affairs Barbara Stephenson](https://global.unc.edu/directory/barbara-stephenson/). He recalls being in school when the [FedEx Global Education Center](https://global.unc.edu/about/about-the-building/) opened its doors.

Many students see the FedEx Global Education Center as the study abroad office. While students can access study abroad materials there, the Center contains much more. It houses programs like the [Global Research Institute](https://gri.unc.edu/), [International Student and Scholar Services](https://isss.unc.edu/) and [Duke-UNC Rotary Peace Center](https://rotarypeacecenternc.org/).

Lassiter works closely with Stephenson to help the UNC-Chapel Hill community understand the many facets of UNC Global.

“If there’s anything I learned from Covid and being in business for the past 10 to 15 years, it’s that you can’t hide from the global stage,” says Lassiter. “All of us to some extent, no matter what career we’re in – medicine, climate, technology, or law – we’re going to have an impact on the global stage. I get to help break down the complicated system and explain it to people in a way people understand.”

Embracing the Future of Workplaces

Lassiter’s career is built on breaking down the complex. Whether he’s interviewing Taco Bell about their hot sauce packets or meeting with clients in San Francisco, he asks the tough questions.

He holds fast to the idea that business can’t just be in it for profit. He believes that pursuing sustainability is vital for a company’s bottom line. An advocate of the profit, people and planet concept of sustainability, Lassiter believes the next generation of students can push the envelope on incorporating sustainability into the workplace.

“We have to turn sustainability into a business decision,” says Lassiter. “You have to make it known during the interview process and when you’re accepting a job. If companies see they’re losing people because they’re not doing anything related to sustainability, that makes it a business issue.”

# Alumni Spotlight: Daina Bray ’98 of Yale Law School answers seven questions about her career in animal law, activism, and frog dissections
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Daina Bray ’98

*Written by Flavia Nunez Ludeiro ’26 of the Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team*

Catch up with Daina Bray ’98, a clinical lecturer in law with Yale Law School’s Law, Ethics & Animals Program, as she answers seven questions. Learn about her time as a scholar, career in animal law, and life in New Haven, Connecticut!

What’s your favorite memory as a scholar?

Derek Bevil ’97 convinced several of us scholars who had never done any acting before to try out for his production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the Forest Theatre. I was cast as one of the leads, Helena, and it was so out of character for me but so memorable. Our last night was marked by a thunderstorm that came rolling in just as we finished the play.

Finish this sentence, “My day isn’t complete without . . . ”

My dogs! My husband and I have two rescued pit bulls from Tennessee and a street dog from Syria who was saved by an animal rescuer there during the war. I am obsessed with them (just ask my husband). The dogs in this picture are my parents’ dogs Da Shu and Xiao Shu, who were rescued from the meat trade in China.

Who is the most interesting person you met as a student at UNC–Chapel Hill?

When I started thinking about this, so many people came to mind. I met an incredible variety of people at UNC–Chapel Hill. I was a kid from upstate New York. At Carolina, I had adventures with other scholars and friends from Greece, Greenwich Village, Rocky Mount, South Africa, Hawaii, the United Kingdom, Brooklyn, Boone, Tijuana, Southern Pines, Sierra Leone, and on and on—it was such an amazing learning experience!

To pick one person, it would be [Dr. Robert Daniels in the Department of Anthropology](https://anthropology.unc.edu/person/robert-daniels/). I loved his classes, especially an independent study on systems theory that truly changed the way I see the interconnectedness of the world.

Tell us about a song you’ve recently enjoyed and why.

My work focuses on the climate crisis and the harms of industrial animal agriculture, which are massive and overwhelming problems. The song “[Resilient” by Rising Appalachia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx17RvPMaQ8) lifts me up. It’s about moving forward, inner strength, and the power of working together.

What does an average weekday look like for you? I get my dogs out and feed them, do some yoga, take some meetings from my home office, and then often head to Yale Law School for meetings with students or the class I’m co-teaching this semester: [Climate, Animal, Food and Environmental Law and Policy Lab (CAFE Lab)](https://law.yale.edu/animals/initiatives/cafe-law-policy-lab).

Do you keep in touch with fellow Morehead-Cain alumni?

I do keep in touch with a number of alumni. Most recently, I’ve enjoyed being in contact with Jamie Whittle ’97, an environmental lawyer in the north of Scotland. Jamie sometimes has students who are interested in animal law. We’ve connected over that, as well as our shared legal experiences and interest in environmental and animal protection.

What accomplishment are you most proud of?

I’m most proud of my full-time career as a lawyer advocating for animals. My work is aligned with issues that I’ve been passionate about since I was a little kid. I have a deep sense of wonder and feeling of respect and responsibility toward animals.

During my Morehead-Cain finalist interview, I remember explaining to the panel how I had successfully opted out of dissecting a frog during high school. Afterwards, they asked, “What advice would you give a student who would like to do the same?” I said that I would tell them to do what I did: call the information hotline 1-800-922-FROG (which was really a thing back then and was very useful before the Internet).

The interviewers laughed in a friendly way, which I thought was a good sign! After all these years, I’m proud that I’ve stayed true to my commitment to activism for animals.

More about Daina

Daina Bray is a Climate Change and Animal Agriculture Senior Litigation Fellow and Project Manager with the Law, Ethics & Animals Program at Yale Law School, as well as a clinical lecturer and senior research scholar in law.

Daina has extensive animal law and litigation practice experience, and a sustained and pragmatic commitment to making a positive difference in the ways that we interact with non-human animals. She previously served as general counsel of the nonprofits Mercy for Animals and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, and practiced with major international law firms in the areas of litigation and international arbitration.

Daina is a member of the American Bar Association (ABA) House of Delegates and a past chair of the ABA International Animal Law Committee, the ABA TIPS Animal Law Committee, and the Tennessee Bar Association Animal Law Section.

Daina received a JD from Stanford Law School, a BA in international studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a Morehead-Cain Scholar, a Fulbright scholarship for research in environmental education, and the 2021 ABA Excellence in the Advancement of Animal Law Award.

# Project by Morehead-Cain Scholars helps launch mobile market to combat food insecurity in Lexington, Kentucky
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

2022 Civic Collaboration Team Lexington

A summer internship project through Morehead-Cain’s [Civic Collaboration](https://www.moreheadcain.org/scholar-experience/summer-enrichment/civic-collaboration/) program has come to fruition with the launch of the [Lexington Mobile Market](https://www.lexingtonky.gov/MobileMarket) in Lexington, Kentucky, this past November.

The “aisle-on-wheels” initiative aims to combat food insecurity by increasing access to fresh produce, milk, and other staples. A 60-foot trailer will make sixty stops per month at twenty-six areas designated as food deserts in the city, according to Tiffany Brown, the equity and implementation officer for the City of Lexington’s Office of the Mayor and host for the 2022 Civic Collaboration team.

The group of scholars was instrumental in forming the implementation plan for the Lexington Mobile Market, Brown said.

“The work and dedication of the scholars were instrumental in accelerating this initiative from an idea to a reality,” she said. The scholars conducted interviews with community stakeholders and research for the project.

“We’re appreciative of the Morehead-Cain Foundation for supporting this work in increasing grocery access for Lexington residents.”

2022 Civic Collaboration Team Lexington comprised Foluwa Agbebi ’25, Noah Gottlieb ’25, Anna Mercer ’25, Sheidy Rios-Vazquez ’25, and Becca Segal ’25. Scholars typically participate in this [Morehead-Cain Summer Enrichment Program](https://www.moreheadcain.org/scholar-experience/summer-enrichment/) before their second year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

For Sheidy Rios-Vazquez ’25, the project allowed her to learn about developing complex solutions.

“Collaborating with the local government on the mobile market project showed me the importance of proactively addressing health inequities to uplift marginalized communities, as well as the significance of community engagement to empower these marginalized groups,” she said, saying the implementation plan included recommendations for sourcing food, selecting access points, building relationships with food retailers, and creating the food stop schedule.

“I am very grateful to have contributed to this initiative that will increase access to nutritious food choices and aid in reducing health disparities, and knowing that the Lexington residents will benefit from this is very fulfilling.”

Creating positive impact through service is at the heart of Civic Collaboration, said Montez Thomas, assistant director of scholar advising at Morehead-Cain and lead of the program.

“It’s not every day that we get to see the ripple effects of Civic Collaboration projects, many of which are initiatives that have been years in the making,” Thomas said. “Witnessing the tangible impact of the scholars’ efforts is deeply gratifying, and we’re thankful to the City of Lexington for partnering with Morehead-Cain to facilitate meaningful experiences for the students.”

During the [Civic Collaboration](https://www.moreheadcain.org/scholar-experience/summer-enrichment/civic-collaboration/) summer, teams of scholars embed themselves in cities across the U.S., investigate those communities’ challenges and opportunities, and propose real solutions.

# David Royle ’78 on the first alumni group travel tour to Italy: ‘It was clear that Morehead-Cain magic was in the air’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

A group of Morehead-Cain Alumni visited Rome and Tuscia, Italy, from October 31 to November 7. The trip was the Foundation’s first alumni group travel experience.

*Written by David Royle ’78, a participant in Morehead-Cain’s first alumni group travel tour to Italy in fall 2023*

Is it sacrilege to say that the main attraction to visit Rome was not a private tour of the Sistine Chapel, an expertly guided walk through the Roman Forum, or even the rapturous art of Gian Lorenzo Bernini? (Will Megan ever forgive me for saying this?)

My wife, Lia, and I on the Spanish Steps in Rome.

It also wasn’t the food, and we ate a lot of good Italian food. In fact, there were times when our visits to museums and archaeological sites seemed mere interludes between courses. But that’s another story.

The overwhelming reason that I signed up with my wife, Lia, to go on the first trip for Morehead-Cain Alumni was the opportunity to spend time with other former scholars . . . in a way, to test the idea that the term “Morehead-Cain cousins” wasn’t just a slogan but had some underlying substance to it.

The trip had been meticulously planned by Megan and Emily, in collaboration with our extraordinary tour director, Jordan Cook—a man whose knowledge of Rome, his energy, and his ability to adapt to last-minute changes with a constant affability left us in awe.

From the moment we arrived at the Rose Garden Palace hotel in Rome, it was clear that Morehead-Cain magic was in the air.

Animated conversations were breaking out all over the lobby. In fact, Jordan, Megan, and Emily had some difficulty corralling everyone. Eventually, discipline prevailed and we were herded out to our vans.

Members of our group at the Villa Medici with Théo Mercier’s exhibition, BAD TIMING, on display.

Every day brought new delights and everywhere we went we were spoiled with the insights of expert guides. We walked through the Roman Forum, toured the Capitoline Museums, and gazed over the Colosseum. A morning with the modern artists Monica Lundy and Daniele Puppi in their studio was a special treat (thank you, Tonya Turner Carroll ’89).

At the French Academy, we were amused to find the entrance to the Villa Medici dotted with cars sticking out of the ground like modern day standing stones, and we met artist-in-residence Dread Scott at the American Academy.

Adding immeasurably to these incredible experiences was, as I had hoped, the conversations with fellow Morehead-Cains—conversations that broke out at every opportunity.

They covered a wide range of subjects and, this is what made them special, they seldom focused on careers or achievements. Instead, they were both personal and eclectic. It really did feel that we were Morehead-Cain cousins who shared a special bond that had been immeasurably strengthened on this trip.

It would be tempting to tell you about all the places we visited, to lead you through the Piazza Navona, where our walking tour started with Bernini’s fountains, or through the opulent Galleria Borghese. But you can read about all this elsewhere. Instead, let me mention a few moments and experiences that especially resonate in my mind.

Sampling olive oil at the home of David Ballard ’78 in Tobia, Italy.

The first was a magical rooftop evening reception at the home of Jerry Horner ’88 on the Via Margutta. It revealed the unexpected personal connections that tie people together. Who would have anticipated that Jerry’s wife, Lisa, and British alumnus Peter Mallinson ’82 would discover that they had both grown up on the small Caribbean nation of Guyana, a country whose complicated history has recently been captured in the moving novel Song, authored by Michelle Jana Chan ’96?

A day later we headed into the Tuscia countryside to visit the beautiful villa and olive farm owned by David Ballard ’78. David treated us to a presentation on Etruscan history followed by an olive oil tasting led by a sommelier. The tasting was a serious event (think wine without the alcohol), and our full attention was expected.

Of course, there is always someone who doesn’t obey the rules. In this case, it was Morehead-Cain’s president, Chris Bradford, who was properly admonished for tasting the oil before permissible. We’ll have to put this impropriety down to a lingering jet lag.

Then, we were off to Vignanello to have lunch with an Italian princess in her mediaeval castle. Princess Claudia greeted us at the Castle Ruspoli, which her family has owned since the eighteenth century, and we sat down to an elegant meal, waited on by uniformed staff, in a dining room lined with ancestral paintings.

Seated for lunch with Princess Claudia.

And finally, there was the last night: a formal dinner as the guests of Bettina and Peter Mallinson at one of Rome’s great private clubs, the Nuovo Circulo degli Scacchi.

With the elegant seventeenth-century setting, fine food, and impeccable service . . . some of us were beginning to think that we could get used to this. But, alas, it was time to go home.

For us, it was ending all too soon. For Megan, the timing was perfect. She would arrive home just in time to welcome her latest grandchild into the world named, so appropriately, “Leo,” after one of the most notable Italian popes.

—David Royle ’78

### More about alumni group travel with Morehead-Cain

One of the great joys of being part of the Morehead-Cain community is spending time with “cousins” of all ages at regional gatherings and the triennial Alumni Forum in Chapel Hill.

The next group travel opportunity will be the Civil Rights tour of the South from April 11 to April 15, 2024, featuring [Taylor Branch ’68](https://taylorbranch.com/), Pulitzer Prize–winning author of the Civil Rights trilogy America in the King Years.

Today’s episode is a recording of a SEVEN Talk from the 2022 Alumni Forum. This talk, given by Bruce Gellin ’77, is entitled, “Serendipitous Lessons.” Bruce is the Chief of Global Public Health Strategy at The Rockefeller Foundation.

[Listen to the episode](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/seven-talk-by-bruce-gellin-77-serendipitous-lessons).

You can [watch all of the SEVEN Talks on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MoreheadCain/streams).

More about Bruce

Bruce Gellin ’77 has pursued a career that’s blended medicine, science, policy, and public health with a focus on infectious diseases and pandemics. He traces all of this to his days at Carolina, where he crafted an interdisciplinary studies program in human biology. When he took a year off in the middle of medical school at Cornell (’83) as a Luce Scholar in the Philippines, he came back with a clearer picture where he was headed.

After completing a residency in internal medicine at Vanderbilt (’86), he became a disease detective in CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service that put him on the ground investigating outbreaks from Leavenworth Penitentiary (a foodborne outbreak of “homemade” ice cream) to New Zealand (an epidemic of bacterial meningitis).

His career in vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases included work at Johns Hopkins and NIH and as a Warren Weaver Fellow at the Rockefeller Foundation. In 2002, he moved to Washington as an Assistant Secretary for Health and Director of the National Vaccine Program Office at the Department of Health and Human Services.

After 15 years in that post (SARS, MERS, Bird Flu, H1N1, and a growing anti-vaccine movement), he was the president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute until last year, when he returned to the Rockefeller Foundation as Chief, Global Public Health Strategy, where he is overseeing their Global Vaccine Initiative and their recently launched Pandemic Prevention Institute.

## Episode Transcription

*When was the last time somebody asked you what your major was? When was the last time you thought about selecting that major or declaring it? I mean, it’s an odd word that you would declare it. You don’t just pick it, but you had to declare it. I thought a lot about that when I declared that I would be a zoology major, and I got to that process a little bit convoluted. I think the only concrete piece was I thought I was good in science, but I’d gone through a lot of different things, and I felt like I was out of options. I’d gotten to Z, I had to check a box, and zoology was it.*

*And then I went to my first class, and it was a shock for me having come from a school with seminar-sized classrooms, now in a class of several hundred eager freshmen. And at the front of the room was a woman in a starch white lab coat writing on the board. That was the era they wrote on the board of the chalk. But the clincher for me about this declaration of a major was when somebody leaned over to me and said, “You know, she’s really famous. She has a cockroach named after her.” I said, “I don’t think that this is the right thing.” And it was time to move on.*

*You’ll remember that first Thanksgiving when you’re a freshman, you go home, and you’re frantically trying to connect with people. You do it poorly, but you’re trying all the time. And it was on the way back, really by accident, that I bumped into somebody who I hadn’t seen since junior high school, really by accident. And he told me he was at Stanford, which I was surprised about, but nevertheless he was at Stanford. But he also told me about his major. It was a new major at Stanford called human biology. And the philosophy behind it was there are a lot of complex problems out there, and unless you have the perspectives of different disciplines, you’re going to be losing something. So they had put together this interdisciplinary program called human biology—humans, biology, complex things. Two weeks later, in the mail comes his well-thumbed course catalog. So back when they wrote on the blackboard, they had printed course catalogs. People sent things to their mail, a different era. And in it it described the philosophy and the history of the program, laid out all the courses and the professors, the disciplines that they came from, and how they were woven together.*

*It was more than I expected. I made an appointment to see Mebane Pritchett, and I’m sure that Chuck and Chris have had a lot of meetings like this, where smooth students come in with some big idea. And I told him my big idea that I like to go to Stanford for just a year and try it out. Ever graceful, graceful, ever gracious. He looked at me over his glasses and said, “What you have there is a roadmap. You’ve got a big place here with a lot of resources. I’ll bet you can make it work here.” Goodbye, Stanford; hello, interdisciplinary studies. And in retrospect, while the content of the courses that was woven into this fabric that fit for me was interesting, and really, the process of putting that together was one of those life lessons. First, I had to find advisors who were going to play along with this. The university required signatures, and I had to find people who would actually sign up for this. And that’s where I began to learn about the kinds of professors here who would be engaged in a plot like this beyond what they were doing, but beyond their sort of usual descriptions of things that they had to do way beyond office hours.*

*And they signed up for it, which is the kind of people who are here, and they didn’t know me, but they liked the idea. Over time, the process was for me to organize monthly meetings. And in retrospect, what was really most interesting about it was I could barely get a word in edgewise with these people because they had big ideas themselves. None of them knew each other. And you could see the conversations that they were having and maybe the conversation, the collaborations that they began. I had four advisors. One from biology, anthropology, psychology, and the School of Public Health. And I’m sure that they are not the only four on this campus who might have played along with us. And I often wonder if it was a different four or some different mix, what advice they might have given that would have led me in some other direction. And the other sort of thing about these advisors was that they really became the first of what I consider accidental mentors—those people who emerge at the right time, at those inflections points in life with the right experience and wisdom to help you think through what your next point is.*

*The word serendipity was coined in the mid-seventeen hundreds, and it was coined from, inspired by, a fairy tale, the Three Princes of Serendip. Serendip was the old Arabic name for Sri Lanka, and it was a story of the three princes and the accidental discoveries that they found in their wanderings, and finding things that they didn’t expect to see. The definition is the blend of accident and sagacity. Serendipity is a powerful force. It leads to many big ideas and leads to important innovations. The Post-it came about when a three M scientist came up with an adhesive which wasn’t exactly what he was looking for, but it was perfect as a bookmark in his church. Himnal when a hunter came back from the fields, pulled the burs off of his socks, looked at them under a microscope, he saw hundreds of tiny hooks that inspired Velcro. And the famous story of Alexander Fleming, later Sir Fleming, Nobel Prize-winner Fleming, who accidentally discovered penicillin when he returned from vacation. It wasn’t the most meticulous microbiology. He returned from vacation, and his plates were full of this fuzzy mold. Before he threw it out, what he noticed was that where there was mold, there were no bacteria. And that was the development of penicillin.*

*Serendipity is the invisible force that brought us all here today. James Turner Morehead, John Motley’s father, was an entrepreneur and industrialist. Among his many ideas was to try to develop a process to develop aluminum, which was a rare metal at the time, in the foundry he had in Eden, North Carolina, near a canal. He tried every chemical concoction he could. Every time he opened the door, it was something else but aluminum. And one of these times when he opened the door, it looked a little bit different. It was a glassy rock. But he did what he had done all these experiments before: he shoveled it out, threw it in the canal. But this time something was different. He did a double take. There are now bubbles trickling up from this sunken sludge. Now, the history isn’t perfectly clear here, but you can imagine the conversation. “I wonder what that’s about. Son, you were a chemistry major at UNC. Why don’t you go figure it out?” So young John goes back to Chapel Hill, and the first thing he has to do is find a professor who wants to play along with this idea. That professor’s name was Venable. And because we know it now as a global research institution, the engine of research is really in graduate students. The graduate student who participated in that was named Kenan again. Where would we all be today, and where would those names be today if it weren’t for that interest in the bubbles?*

*It turns out that this rock was calcium carbide, found later to be helpful to purify steel and was responsible for the growth of the steel industry. The gas acetylene was used initially in streetlights, but then also part of the steel industry in welding and cutting. Again, serendipity is a powerful force. It’s the serendipity that brings us here today. And I think of the forum as maybe intentional serendipity. We come back, we reconnect with people we’ve lost track with. We connect with people we haven’t met before and inspire new conversations, maybe new collaborations. Unclear where it goes. But it’s also a reminder of the time that we were here. Because when we came, we came with some preparation. We had much more preparation. We were here. And we went on because of that preparation to see whatever career paths we had regardless of our major.*

*And it was interesting because at the same time that the Moreheads were looking at bubbles, that’s really the same time that Louis Pasteur once said, “Chance favors the prepared mind. So in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead, as you think about the path that you’re taking, turn off your GPS every once in a while, and take that road not traveled unless you do it. You’ll never know what’s down there. And when you do, and about the time when you think you’re lost, look for that intersection of accident and sagacity. And if you’re lucky, you’ll know it when you see it.*

*Thanks.*

[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

From left to right: Makayla Key ’24, Lindley Andrew ’24, and Maya Groff ’24

Three Morehead-Cain Scholars have received [Chancellor’s Awards](https://chancellorsawards.unc.edu/awards/), the only campus-wide student recognition program at the University at North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Makayla Key ’24 received a [student activity and leadership award](https://chancellorsawards.unc.edu/2024-student-activities-leadership-awards/) while Lindley Andrew ’24 and Maya Groff ’24 received [student academic awards](https://chancellorsawards.unc.edu/2024-student-academic-awards/).

THE IRENE F. LEE AWARD Recipient: Makayla Key ’24

Irene F. Lee, who served as hostess and counselor in Cornelia Phillips Spencer Hall from 1925 to 1948, established this award in 1955. The award is presented annually to the woman of the senior class who is judged most outstanding in leadership, character, and scholarship.

“Makayla has made her mark as an outstanding model of service, character, and leadership throughout her four years on campus. As president of the Theta Pi Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority and a Morehead-Cain Scholar, she has shown continuously that she is committed to improving herself and finding ways to improve the community, as well.”

THE PETER C. BAXTER MEMORIAL PRIZE IN AMERICAN STUDIES Recipient: Lindley Andrew ’24

Established in 1972, this award honors the outstanding senior in the Department of American Studies. Presented in memory of Peter Baxter, a student of American Studies, the prize is awarded to the undergraduate in that discipline who best exemplifies Mr. Baxter’s intellectual excellence, personal warmth, and contribution to the American Studies Program.

“Lindley is a remarkable student who tackles controversial and painful topics with keen intellect and deep human compassion. She is dedicated to using her talents in American Studies, Latin American Studies, and Spanish language studies to advance the interests of underserved communities.”

THE VENABLE MEDAL Recipient: Maya Groff ’24

The Venable Medal was established in 1955 by Rho Chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma and is presented annually by members of that professional chemistry fraternity to the two most outstanding seniors majoring in chemistry. Two medals are awarded. The selection of one recipient is based on scholastic and academic work within the chemistry program. The other is based on outstanding academic work, character, and outstanding contributions to the University community and to chemistry. The awards bear the name of Francis Preston Venable, chemistry professor from 1880 to 1930 and president of the University from 1900 to 1914.

# Alumni reflections from the Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South with historian Taylor Branch ’68
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Participants on the 2024 Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South outside Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.

In April, a group of around thirty alumni and their guests went on a civil rights bus tour of the South as part of Morehead-Cain’s [Alumni Journeys](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/page/alumni-travel) initiative launched last fall.

For the first part of the trip, civil rights historian Taylor Branch ’68 accompanied the group throughout Montgomery, Alabama. The alumnus is known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning trilogy chronicling the life of Martin Luther King Jr., [America in the King Years](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-King-Years/Taylor-Branch/9781451662467).

The alumni visited Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, pastored by King and the launching point for the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, the Freedom Rides Museum, and three sites established by the [Equal Justice Initiative](https://eji.org/) (founded and led by renowned attorney and social justice activist Bryan Stevenson): the Legacy Museum, National Memorial for Peace and Justice, and the newly opened Freedom Monument Sculpture Park.

For Benjeil Edghill ’98, walking in King’s footsteps reinforced for him that achieving civil rights is “an ongoing battle” in the United States.

“We must never give up on our pursuit of a more just and equitable America, because injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” he said.

On the second day, alumni traveled to Birmingham, Alabama, to walk through the Kelly Ingram park and hear from Carolyn Maull McKinstry, an eyewitness to the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963 and a lifelong civil rights activist who marched under King.

Dave Brunson ’64 reflected that although he was in his twenties during the height of the civil rights movement, the trip brought him closer to the lived experiences of Black Americans who were fighting for justice at the time.

“To listen to those who experienced the church bombings, the loss of their house to the building of an interstate . . . everything felt very personal,” the alumnus said.

For the final day of the tour, the group visited the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel, the site of King’s assassination, in Memphis, Tennessee. Members of Hattiloo Theatre, one of the country’s few all-Black repertory theaters, performed an original work for the group at the museum.

After lunch at the historic Four Way Restaurant, alumni went on a driving tour of the city, including stops at the I AM A MAN Plaza (adjacent to the Clayborn Temple), the gathering place for the 1968 sanitation workers’ strike, and the Slave Haven Underground Railroad Museum. The afternoon came to an end with a tour of the Stax Museum of American Soul Music.

For Steve Toben ’78, the experience facilitated “potential for powerful action across generations” of scholars.

“I cannot begin to express how meaningful the connections enabled by these trips are among alumni, staff, and current scholars,” he said.

The Foundation is grateful to Barbara Rosser Hyde ’83 and Pitt Hyde for hosting the group at their home in Memphis to conclude the trip, as well as for facilitating the tour and private performance at the National Civil Rights Museum.

# Shivam Bhargava ’22 on the Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South: ‘I left this trip feeling inspired and motivated to make a change’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Shivam Bhargava ’22, Dr. Benjeil Edghill ’98, Pam Kelley, and Dinita James ’81 on the second day of the civil rights tour in Birmingham, Alabama.

Written by Shivam Bhargava ’22, program manager at Asian Health Coalition in Chicago and a Global Health Corps U.S. Fellow

In April, I participated in the [Morehead-Cain Civil Rights tour of the South](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/news/1981542) with around thirty alumni and guests to learn more about our country’s history and struggle for racial justice.

As a public health professional who works with communities of color in Chicago, it is critical for me to understand the historical context of the inequities and discrimination I see in the communities that I work with. By making these connections to history, I hope this will prepare me to be a more caring and compassionate physician prepared to treat individuals of all backgrounds.

**This trip gave me the space to think deeply about systemic racism and how that relates back to modern day social issues like health disparities and education inequities**. I left with a better idea of how history relates back to today.

I was able to connect the parallels between the civil rights movement and segregation to issues such as police brutality and the Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action. I left this trip feeling inspired and motivated to make a change, knowing that history is still repeating itself in many ways in our country today.

**One of my favorite moments from the trip was connecting with alum Dave Brunson ’64.** After realizing that I was the youngest alumnus on the trip, and he was the oldest alumnus, we immediately connected over our stark differences in experiences at Carolina.

I asked Dave for one piece of advice for my future, and he said to “never stop learning, no matter what age you are.” I was inspired by his advice as I watched him take notes throughout the trip on everything he was learning related to the civil rights era.

I was impressed as he pulled out his iPad and jotted down new epiphanies and reflections after going through every museum room. As I continue to progress through life, I only hope to have half the thirst for knowledge and love for learning that Dave continues to have.

# Morehead-Cain Mentor Andrea Stumpf ’84 on taking an ‘exploratory approach’ to mentorship
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Andrea Stumpf ’84

Written by Cate Miller ’25, Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team

For Andrea Stumpf ’84, serving as a Morehead-Cain Mentor was a perfect way to “make a difference” as an alumna.

During their first conversation, Andrea was surprised at how much she and her mentee, Ann Goulian ’25, had to talk about. (The Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program pairs scholars with alumni based on shared values and interests.)

“Our meeting was informal but quite wonderful, with a fluidity to the conversation,” she said. “We were able to quickly enter our comfort zones, naturally gravitating towards discussion surrounding women in the working world.”

The experience of being a mentor has affirmed for Andrea that there may indeed be some words of wisdom she has to offer as an experienced professional, she said.

“It’s very validating for the person you’re helping, but it’s also extremely validating for yourself, to draw from your past and make something useful out of it for someone else,” said Andrea, principal at [Structured Partnerships](https://www.structuredpartnerships.com/) in Kensington, Maryland. “It’s a simple and discreet way to help.”

Throughout their meetings, she’s encouraged Ann to pursue opportunities that are different from the ones the scholar has done in college and through the Summer Enrichment Program.

“As you expand your experiences, your ability to see the bigger picture increases more and more,” the alumna said. Before founding her own partnership advising firm, she worked in government, law firms, private companies, and a multilateral development institution.

Andrea said mentoring conversations are often open-ended, allowing her mentee the freedom to choose the focus.

“We take an exploratory approach to our meetings, where I’m in reactive mode to what Ann is thinking about, and she sets the stage for me to help her in the best way possible,” she said. “When you make the transition to the post-grad world, you see more of what the world is about, and it’s important to take an exploratory approach there, too.”

This is the third and final edition of [my series](index-123.html) about Morehead-Cain Mentors based in Washington, D.C. For the [second piece](index-115.html), I spoke with David von Storch ’80.

# Morehead-Cain Mentor David von Storch ’80: ‘Experiencing failure frees you up to succeed’
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

David von Storch ’80

Written by Cate Miller ’25, Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team

When Morehead-Cain asked David von Storch ’80 to serve as a mentor, he gave an immediate and enthusiastic “yes.” David had never participated in a mentoring program and didn’t quite know what to expect, but he wanted to “contribute to the next generation of scholars,” he said.

“Mentoring became a meaningful way for me to give back to the Foundation, which has given me so many opportunities and connections I wouldn’t have had otherwise,” David said. The alumnus is the CEO and founder of [Urban Adventures Companies, Inc.,](https://uacompanies.com/) in Washington, D.C.

The Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program paired David with Hunter Vaughan ’24, a double major in business administration and public policy at Carolina. The scholar said he was interested in signing up to gain wisdom and advice for what comes next after college.

“It’s been great to hear about David’s career journey, the topics he’s passionate about, and connect lessons from his entrepreneurial journey,” said Hunter, an incoming business analyst at McKinsey & Company in D.C. Outside of planning for post-graduation, the two have talked about graduate school, fitness, and ways to optimize the last few months on campus.

“I’m also interested in what it takes to start a business, and he has deep experience in that area,” Hunter said.

The pair have discussed ideas behind successful ventures and the logistics of building a startup. Other common themes have been preparing for pivots and failure, according to David.

“I’ve told Hunter that if you can get your hands around what failure looks like during your endeavors, you’ll be okay because experiencing failure frees you up to succeed,” the mentor said.

David has encouraged Hunter to be comfortable with not knowing what his career trajectory will look like, and to prioritize fostering a “trustworthy support system” of people you can rely on.

“It’s normal to not know your passion, calling, or your ‘why’ when you’re twenty-one years old. For me, it took until my mid-forties to look around and feel like this is where I belong professionally,” the entrepreneur said.

He said pouring into a scholar has been an affirming experience, particularly given the shared affinities for the Program and University.

“For alumni considering mentoring: you should realize that you’re a part of a very special group of people, you have skills and experience to share, and there’s value in all of that,” he said. “Why not embrace and share that with the next generation?”

# Anna Connors ’24, Aayas Joshi ’26 awarded Rich Beckman Documentary Award to document effects of climate change in Arctic Circle
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Anna Connors ’24 and Aayas Joshi ’26 have received the [2023 Rich Beckman Documentary Award](http://hussman.unc.edu/rich-beckman-documentary-award) from the UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media.

The award goes to a journalism student or students to “conduct fieldwork for documentary storytelling or interactive multimedia projects,” according to the school.

Anna and Aayas are teaming up to research and document the effects of the climate crisis on indigenous communities near the Arctic Circle. The scholars will be based in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, for several weeks in December 2023.

The project will expand upon Anna’s previous research on how climate change is impacting ecosystems, and Aayas’s research from his [Morehead-Cain International Gap Year](https://www.moreheadcain.org/scholar-experience/international-gap-year/) on the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized communities in the Himalayas.

[Aayas shared about his gap year on Morehead-Cain’s Catalyze podcast](https://www.moreheadcain.org/2022/12/the-travel-episode-stories-from-the-morehead-cain-international-gap-year-with-aayas-joshi-26-olu-kopano-26-and-scholar-host-elias-guedira-26/#:~:text=For%20our%20listeners%2C%20Aayas%20and,World%20College%20in%20Changshu%2C%20China.).

.

Anna’s connection to Churchhill began in 2015 through the International Student-led Arctic Monitoring and Research program. The scholar researched in the Wapusk National Park south of Churchill to better understand how a warming planet affects permafrost, polar bears, and soil microbial communities in the area.

Anna left the experience “feeling like Churchill had a unique story,” she said.

“The media has focused on the region’s tourism—its polar bears and northern lights—but there is so much to learn from the community of people who call Churchill home,” Anna said. “As a media and journalism student, I see the immense potential in Churchill that’s been overlooked by most journalistic projects in the region.”

The scholars will be in Canada during the off season of tourism—a strategic choice to focus on nontourism sectors, according to Aayas.

“We want to tell Churchill’s story in a way that puts its people at the center,” said Aayas, a media and journalism major at Carolina and a photographer on the Morehead-Cain Scholar Media Team. “We have a lot to learn before we leave this winter.”

## Episode Transcription

(Aayas)

*It’s 1:24 a.m., and I am standing outside my tent on the world’s highest glacier. On Everest, you only get one weather window a year to attempt to climb, and I was just told it opened up an hour ago.*

*In front of me on the icefall, I see tiny specks of light moving up. Originating from all corners of the planet, after years of preparation, these specs emanate from the headlamps of the most determined people in the world.*

*Earlier this evening, I met climbers fundraising for disability awareness, for victims of war, advocates bridging racial gaps in mountaineering, climate scientists, documentary teams, and those pushing the known limits of the human body.*

*Base camp is a congregation of the most inspiring people and the most fascinating stories. It’s no wonder I’ve been standing here absolutely mesmerized. I’m in disbelief of where I am, atop a shifting glacier, standing taller than entire continents, next to a lake of clouds shrouding the valley below us, and surrounded by towering peaks glistening next to a rising moon.*

*Just me, my camera, and the captivating stillness of a night in the Himalayas.*

(Olu)

*Two vans to my left. They pull off. Seven lions in front of me. Click, click, click. One hundred photos, 30 minutes, one place. The first lion goes down, the second goes down, the third goes down, and the fourth follows. Edwin says, “A hunt is about to occur.” We take off, the wind brushing our face. The binoculars out. We’re following. Turn left. 1.5 kilometers later, we reach the spot. Boom. The lioness strikes a baby buffalo under the brush. The three lionesses follow. They arrive at the scene. Everyone in the van shocked. The male lion approaches the scene, takes the baby buffalo. The lioness is pushed against our van. We’re all frozen. Click, click, click.*

(Elias)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Elias Guedira, from the class of 2026. Joining us today are Aayas Joshi and Olu Kopano from the class of 2026. The two scholars went on an international gap year through Morehead-Cain. Aayas and Olu share their discoveries and reflections from their time abroad, as well as advice for incoming scholars.*

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining the podcast today.*

(Aayas)

*Thank you.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us on here.*

(Elias)

*For our listeners, Aayas and Olu are both wrapping up their first semester at UNC after taking a gap year through Morehead-Cain’s International Gap Year program. Olu graduated from St. Paul’s School in Baltimore, Maryland, while Aayas graduated from United World College in Changshu, China. Fun fact about Aayas, he is actually the first Morehead-Cain scholar from Nepal. Olu and Aayas, I hope you’ve had a smooth time adapting to life back here in the classroom, but also sufficient time to reflect on your gap year experiences. How does it feel to be back in a traditional learning environment?*

(Olu)

*It feels good. I had a magnificent year, probably the year where I was able to have the most and do the most learning that I’ve done in my life. But near the end of it, I was ready to be back in the school setting. And that school setting looks different now than what it would have pre-gap year. Pre-gap year, I was thinking business, minor in Japanese, and neither of those are in the equation now. Global studies, most likely, and pursuing Spanish, and it’s exactly what I want. I’m taking classes I’m passionate about and have found a direction that I like.*

(Elias)

*Nice.*

(Aayas)

*For me, coming back to conventional education, traditional education, has been interesting. I feel like my gap year prepared me for leaving home and the subtle chaos that is the first semester of college, but also because my gap year helped me decide what path I wanted to take for college, similar to what Olu was saying. And so what I’m studying now feels a little more intentional because I can connect it with what I learned on my gap year.*

(Elias)

*It’s so incredible being able to gain that experience, especially before going into college, really getting to explore the world outside of it before delving into it. So, thank you again for being on the podcast. So, flashback to March 2021. You’re looking at your computer or phone, or mobile device, and you learn that you’ve just received the Morehead-Cain scholarship. What prompts you to say, “Hey, I’m going to press a pause button on my college education and take a gap year for now?”*

(Olu)

*It was the idea that I have loved travel. I was able to travel to Tokyo in high school, had such a memorable experience, and I was missing that feeling. I had opportunities to travel later in high school, but COVID-19 hit, and that ended all possibility of that. So thinking of going into another year of schooling and missing out on the travel that I potentially could have had, just like I’d missed out in the past, was just an opportunity that I felt like I couldn’t miss again, especially when Morehead was funding a significant part of it.*

(Aayas)

*For me, I went to an international school, and so what happened was after they initially sent us back home for COVID, they weren’t able to bring us back. And so, I had gone through one and a half years of online school and was feeling pretty burned out by that point. And I’ve also always believed that the way that the system works right now tends to rush kids into choosing their life’s path of like 17, 18 years old when they haven’t really had a chance to explore what they really want to do. And so, I really liked the idea of taking a pause and exploring my interests in trying to find out what I want to pursue for college.*

*And I think what ended up prompting me to actually take the gap year was, ironically, the Catalyze podcast. I remember, I was listening to the gap year episode before this one, and it was Taylor’s voice—Taylor Shinal, class of ’25—and she was talking about her experience in the Serengeti, watching The Great Migration. And I remember listening to that at home and, like, pacing around my room saying, “I need to do this. This is exciting.”*

(Olu)

*Now that you mentioned that, it was honestly, I can vividly remember the time when I heard the Catalyze podcast on the gap year. And I went, I was sitting on the couch with my dad, and we were listening to it, and we both gave each other the same look and said, “You’re going to do this, you’re going to take this gap year.” And here I am.*

(Elias)

*Yeah, this is a full two years later. It’s such an incredible feeling. I mean, I was also in that same position, having taken a gap year myself, and I remember listening to this podcast and thinking, “Wow, what they did was super cool.” And the fact that we all get to be on the other side of it is such a treat. So a lot of people ended up taking gap years during COVID. Did you have any concerns that this was the wrong path initially? And what would you have to say to anybody that’s taking a gap year right now and might feel a little bit lost?*

(Olu)

*I don’t know if I had any concerns that it was the wrong path, but it is not just one path. It is an experience that is up to you to decide. And that’s scary. That is something that people don’t like. That’s something at one point that I was scared of. I had done all this research, and it led to nothing. And I thought, “What is this gap year going to be? What am I going to do? I have no clue what it’s going to look like.”*

*I was getting frustrated with myself. It was a difficult period, but it was ultimately one of the most rewarding periods of my life because I was, for the first time, had the power to decide what I was going to do with my life for a complete year.*

*So for people in this position now and struggling with what they might potentially do for the second half of the gap year, or if they’re thinking about it in the future, I would say lean into that discomfort because the other side will be better.*

(Elias)

*So if you were to condense your gap year travels into a storybook with chapters, what would you entitle each of those chapters, and what would the setting have been for each of them?*

(Olu)

*That’s a really good question. So I think this kind of goes off my last answer, and the first part was about diving in. So I would label the first chapter, which was Costa Rica, “Diving.” And that was diving into a language that I was unfamiliar with, diving into a culture and area that I was unfamiliar with, and diving into a project, which was construction, and building homes for single mothers, which obviously I had not done construction before. So everything was new. Everything was diving full force into it. And that was probably the first chapter.*

*And the second chapter would be “Solo.” Solo was in Saint Lucia. It was just me there. I was working an internship, and I didn’t know anybody. I had one family member, but other than that, that was it. And my nights were spent by myself. Most of my days were spent by myself. And that period was so important to the growth that I was able to develop later.*

*And the third chapter would be “Homecoming.” Homecoming because I was in Africa in that period. I traveled to Tanzania, Egypt, and Morocco. And even though I’d never been to Africa, my family, me, all of us included, we’ve always felt connected to Africa in some sense or another. And being able to actually step foot on the motherland was really important to me. And really, it felt like I was at home.*

*And I guess the last chapter would just be maybe “Jump Around.” I was in Europe, and I went to seven different countries. I stayed in Spain for six weeks, and then the other six were five days here, five days there. And each chapter was very pivotal in the gap year.*

(Aayas)

*My chapters would be slightly different. I think the first chapter I would call, “Hey, why don’t we go to Everest?” Fun little hike. So I had lived in Nepal for 18, 19 years, and I had never seen Mount Everest. So I told a group of friends, “Why don’t we go hiking and go see it?” And so that was the first chapter.*

*The second chapter I would call, “Oops, I accidentally hitchhiked the entire South Asian coast” because that was not the intention when I left home. I left on a fairly spontaneous international flight to New Delhi, and I happened to travel for almost two months, over 8,000 miles, 26 cities, around the entire South Asian coastline. So that was really fun.*

*Chapter three would probably be “Returned to Everest for a cause.” So that’s when I started to work on climate change projects in the region.*

*And the fourth project would be, I’d probably call it “The heritage project.” So for context, in 2015, Nepal faced a mega earthquake that flattened half of my city. And so a big debate that was sparked after that was, how do we preserve and document heritage so that we don’t lose it again? And I worked with a professor at UNC actually, a religious studies professor at UNC, on documenting tangible and intangible heritage 3D models, things like that. So that was a really cool project that I worked on, but those would be my four chapters.*

(Elias)

*So when you say documenting tangible and intangible artifacts, what exactly do you mean by that?*

(Aayas)

*It was really cool, actually. We had a team of people, and we would fly LiDAR drones around heritage sites to then 3D model them later. And the goal was to be able to create a virtual space where you can access this heritage and also have annotated stories and pictures and ways to explore the area without actually being there, so that if another earthquake does come and destroys the heritage, there’s still a replica or a version of it that we can still visit later.*

(Elias)

*Aayas, for viewers that are unfamiliar with your line of work, you spend a lot of time documenting monuments, documenting stories through photography, storytelling, and blogging. In fact, you’re working on a project with the goal of helping integrate Himalayan communities into scientific research and documenting the effects of global warming on these communities to spread awareness. Can you talk a little bit more about how you got involved with this project during your gap year?*

(Aayas)

*The first time I went to Everest Base Camp, I was amazed by how beautiful it is and all of that. But I was also very shocked by how many concerning things I saw that I had not heard about or I don’t think people generally knew about.*

*I remember this specific moment when I was walking on a glacier, the world’s highest glacier; it’s called the Khumbu Glacier. It was at 5,500 meters in elevation, that’s approximately 18 \[thousand\] feet, I believe. And we were walking on a solid glacier, and my foot went into the glacier, so it went into a meltwater pond. And my guide then was shocked and surprised, and he kept saying, “That’s not supposed to happen. This is not supposed to be melting. These puddles weren’t here last week.” And that got me really concerned. That experience is something I couldn’t forget even after I went back.*

*And so I started doing some research, and I started seeing these really concerning headlines, things along the lines of, the region is warming three times faster than the global average, or Everest alone has lost more than 2,000 years’ worth of ice and snow in the last 30 years, and how climate change in the region is expected to impact 1.5 billion people in South Asia. That’s one in every four humans. And so, after hearing all of that and realizing that not a lot of people knew about it, I thought that I wanted to do something. But at the time, I didn’t really know what I could do other than spread the word. So I tabled it for some time, and then I went on my India trip, and this thought of “I should do something” kept bothering me. I couldn’t let it go.*

*Coincidentally, after my India trip, I had other international plans that, because of visa issues, passport issues, or generally COVID restrictions, I had to cancel. And so I took that as a sign that I should go back to Everest. And I told myself, I’m going back. This time I’m going to take my filming gear with me, and I’m going to try to document what I saw and share it with others because maybe if people saw what I saw, maybe if people heard the stories that I heard, they would want to know more about the issue. They would care about it. And so that was the goal.*

*And before I went, I went on the Morehead-Cain Network, and I found Noam Argov. She’s the class of 2015. She’s a documentary filmmaker. So I sent her an email saying, “Hey, I really want to work on this. Do you know it? Do you have any advice, any wisdom for me?” (Hey, Noam, if you’re listening to this, very grateful to you.) But she linked me with this nonprofit called Himalayan Climate and Science Institute, and with them, I was able to work on projects integrating local communities with scientific research.*

*So the project that they were working on aimed to train local community members there to work on weather stations so that we don’t have to, like, fly out technicians and scientists from the other side of the world, which would speed up the data collection process quite a lot.*

(Elias)

*It’s so wonderful that you were able to capture the effects, the disproportional effects that climate change really has on people, especially in communities where people may feel unheard or not linked to media or scientific research. So I’d like to applaud you for all the great work that you’re doing there.*

*Olu, you entitled the portion of your gap year that you spent in Saint Lucia “Solo.” From my understanding, you spent a significant amount of time alone when you were working in Saint Lucia. You frequently mention that you had realizations while you were staying in the country, while you were spending nights and days by yourself. Can you share with listeners what you found to be the value of being alone and any discoveries you had about yourself or the environment?*

(Olu)

*First, being alone, I think the biggest discovery was surrounding learning, and I think I hinted at it earlier where I said the gap year was the year that I felt like I’d done the most learning ever in my life. And I really think that started in Saint Lucia. I honestly wasn’t the most excited as I was when I was going to Tanzania and Spain when it came to Saint Lucia, because I was alone, and I had not been alone for a significant period of time. Even when I was in Costa Rica, I joined a program, I was with a ton of people my age. But now I had an internship with middle-aged individuals, and then I was back in, just me, and that was scary.*

*So I wasn’t really the most excited for it. But again, I leaned into it, and it paid off. I had time to think about, just self-reflect. I had time to engage in different podcasts. I had time to start my Spanish learning and picking up Quizlet. I had time to read. And just by being alone, I learned more about myself. I found interests that I didn’t know I had.*

*And one more thing. Going off of the second part that you had about learning about the environment around me, I think this actually wasn’t done alone, but having that kind of experience where I was more tuned in to the place that I was working and place I was living. I definitely think I had some of those experiences.*

*So one, really quickly, would be working in concierge at a five-star resort. I was surrounded by other employees from Saint Lucia, and Saint Lucia, for those who don’t know, was colonized by the French and by the British, and it was a seven-time colonized by the French and eight-time by the U.K. And just looking at the effects that it had on how people were treated was very, very present. So a lot of folks from the U.K. would go to Saint Lucia for holiday, and I could see instantly the dynamic where the treatment was still from some sort of colonial approach, where, whether it was a demeaning tone or a place of “I’m better than you,” and it was really interesting to just be on the outside of that.*

*And yes, I looked like the Saint Lucians, but when I was approached, and when I was talking with guests, I could instantly see the difference because I didn’t have that St. Lucian background, and maybe having that time reflecting, being in that place where I was learning and creating and exploring my identity as well, I was able to see that in a different lens.*

(Elias)

*It’s so interesting being able to dive into that environment, especially from an American perspective. You kind of get to see the effects that colonialism and systemic injustices have on other countries and how your experience differs vastly from other people’s just because of your nationality.*

*Now, Olu, you mentioned doing a lot of things that you seem to appreciate more while you were alone. For me, I love to channel my thoughts through journaling and blogging. I also spent a considerable amount of time on Duolingo improving my languages. How did you go about expressing yourself, whether that was through journaling or storytelling among friends and family?*

(Olu)

*Journaling was definitely number one. I looked back at it the other day, actually, at my gap year journal, and I had over 60,000 words, I had around 100 pages of journaling, and whether it was only a few sentences a day or two pages a day, and that was more for me. That was more of the self-reflection. That was more of seeing the growth that I had from the beginning of the gap year to the end.*

*But I also had other forms, whether it was my Instagram and keeping people engaged with photos and stories, or whether it was just through photography. For example, in Tanzania, when we were there, actually, during the Serengeti trip, I was able to take over 1.200—1,300 photos and videos, and I still have them as my screensavers today. And just, that being a reminder of what is out there in the world and seeing incredible sites, Ngorongoro Crater, lions hunts, and elephants. And knowing that that can happen, and I lived that, and I look forward to doing something like that. And again, and obviously, that’s all thanks to Morehead, the Morehead-Cain funding that I was able to receive from them.*

(Elias)

*Wonderful. And you, Aayas?*

(Aayas)

*For me, I must say, Elias, it was actually you that inspired me to start documenting more. I remember in the beginning of the year when you and Spence took that road trip across North America, and you had a blog, and you were posting pictures. I remember looking at it and going, “That is so cool. I want to start doing more of that, too, like documenting more of my journeys.”*

*And so I’ve always loved photography. And so when I went trekking, when I went on my different gap year trips, I started taking pictures and posting little story blogs and story sessions on Instagram, and that’s where most of my documenting happened. Personally, I also journaled quite a bit. I had an online journal that has thousands and thousands of words. It’s always nice to look back at some of them and see a year ago I was here doing this.*

(Elias)

*I feel so honored that I inspired you to take a blogging and photography, and I also have to respect you for what you have done with it and how you have gone about documenting your gap year. I have always admired that.*

(Aayas)

Thank you, Elias.

(Elias)

*Okay, this is a tough question. What is your favorite memory from your gap year?*

(Olu)

*I often tell people, I kind of break it up into experiences, and I might cheat a little bit with this question.*

*My favorite experience was the, I think it was seven of us in Tanzania and the Serengeti trip that we had, a seven day experience where we’re living out in tents and we’re hearing hyenas right behind us while we’re trying to sleep, and we’re waking up to elephants tearing down trees. That would probably be my favorite experience.*

*And my favorite trip would be you and me, actually, in Morocco, eight days where were in Rabat, we’re in Marrakesh, and we take a three-day, two-night trip to the Sahara, and we’re riding camels into the sunset and going to sleep in the Sahara and waking up and sand boarding through the dunes. And I would probably say those two experiences were the most memorable and my favorite memories, for sure.*

(Aayas)

*One of my favorite experiences that was actually recurring throughout my gap year was seeing the Milky Way.*

*So I love stargazing, personally, and so to be able to see the Milky Way in the sky from different places: one, from Everest Base Camp when I was surrounded by the glistening peaks, the world’s highest mountains towering over me. Seeing the Milky Way on the night that I bivvied in the Thar Desert—it’s in northwest India. The day that we found an oasis and slept next to it.*

*Seeing the Milky Way from the backwaters of Kerala in a tropical rainforest, and then seeing the Milky Way next to bioluminescent waves on the southernmost tip of South India. That would probably be my favorite experience for my gap year, seeing the same thing across these different places.*

(Elias)

*I know there’s so many things to choose from, and personally, I cannot pick one single favorite memory from the gap year. I think they’re all special in their own ways. My final question for you, if you could give one piece of advice to your pre-gap year self, what would that piece of advice be?*

(Olu)

*Don’t make a plan. That might not be the advice that I should be giving right now, but I think the most important experiences that I had in my gap year weren’t planned. They were made by mistake. They happened because my plan fell through, and I had to come up with something different.*

*I think having that flexibility to find an interest and be in a country, and then that spark an idea of what to do next, where to go next, that would be what I say to do. Don’t have a plan. Don’t create a whole year of what you think you’re going to do because you won’t do it. Lean into the unknown and stick with it.*

(Aayas)

*I really agree with that, Olu. My advice to myself would be very similar. The best place for you is where you naturally gravitate to and not necessarily the path you carve out for yourself.*

*I know you guys know this, Olu and Elias, but for the listeners, prior to going on my gap year trips, I thought Morehead-Cain was really strict with what they wanted me to do and how I could use their stipend. So I produced an 83-page PDF of my gap year plan. I planned every single day. It had maps, it had color-coded calendars, and I ended up doing almost none of that.*

*I’m very glad that it worked out that way, because I would not trade the experiences I had on my gap year for anything.*

(Elias)

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining Catalyze today.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us. It was a pleasure.*

(Elias)

*Thank you for joining Catalyze. I’m Elias Guedira from the class of 2026, and that was Olu Kapano and Aayas Joshi from the class of 2026.

(Abbey Beebe ’27)

*Hello, everyone. This is Abbey Beebe.*

*I am a current gap year scholar, and right now, I’m on an island off the coast of Honduras called Utila, and it’s about 9:52 p.m., and I just jumped into the Caribbean Sea.*

*And I want you to picture every time you move a limb, so you kick or you move your arm, the ocean lights up like a galaxy full of stars. And this is because of the bioluminescence.*

*And it’s truly a magical experience. And it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. And I’m just lucky to be here.*

(Elias)

*It’s mid-October. The sun shines, golden. Transparent, deep blue sky colliding with gleaming sands in the horizon. I look at the point of earth stretching highest to the sun, Erg Chebbi, the tallest dune in Morocco, and among those in the Sahara Desert. An unforeseen impulse rises in me, screaming in me, telling me to climb.*

*I call out to my friend from Arabic class. She wears an orange and black caftan and a scarf, protecting her vision from the sun’s piercing rays. She looks on from a nearby ridge, observing like a tiger. I let her know it could take a while before I come down.*

*I dig my foot into the mountain before me and begin. Grains of sand sift beneath my toes while an hourglass sifts above my head. The sun above me encroaches the earth. As I wear a blue jillaba, I fight its fabric clawing at my feet, holding my movement as I climb. Suddenly, the sand loses grip of the mountain it’s clinging to. The sound of friction as the particles slide. I lose my footing. Now, futilely, I’m stretching my feet and arms into the only surface I can see in front of me.*

*I breathe. Regain control. The sun pulls closer. As I ascend, I hear voices in another language. Blurs of movement behind heat waves. Two tourists enjoying their first days in Morocco. We trade names and stories. We appreciate two vastly different views.*

*I look back to my friend. Behind her neck, tents and base camp. And then, the Hamada. A barren expanse of rock desert. Shale floating on eerily still sand like melting ice on the surface of a lake. Shards of rock cracking and drifting apart. Black mountains fold upward in the distance, indicating the last frontier before Algeria.*

*I turn around towards the sun setting in front of me, an ocean of sand. Waves arcing in every direction, formations that must have been caused by some sort of tempest. Below, at the horizon, riders on camelbacks piercing their way through the rolling dunes like ships in a storm. I stay here for a moment, admiring the stillness from above. Breeze blows from the west. The sun meets earth and back into the quiet storm. I descend.*

(Chandler Beals ’27)

*Hello, everyone.*

*My name is Chandler Beals, and I am a current gap year scholar. And right now, I’m sitting at the Las Vegas airport. I have a layover here on my way home from Baja California Sur, Mexico, where I did the Baja Sea Kayaking course through the National Outdoor Leadership School, NOLS.*

*Yes, I just had a really mediocre panini, and I’m sitting here with my iced coffee, just kind of people watching and reflecting on my trip. I feel very content, very thankful, and also a little sad. It’s hard to live with people for an entire month and really get to know them well, and then, just as quickly as you came, have to leave them behind.*

*With traveling a lot, I feel like my heart’s in a lot of different places, but at the same time, it’s a really good feeling. And, yeah, I leave for Sweden in a week, and I’m really happy to be here.*

## Episode transcription

(Mary)

Hi, my name is Mary Esposito. I’m from Raleigh, North Carolina, and I’m currently studying business.

(Christopher)

Hi, my name is Christopher Arraya, and I’m from Woodbridge, Virginia. I’m a double major in computer science and sociology.

(Kassandra)

Hi, my name is Kassandra Ciriza-Monreal. I’m from Asheboro, North Carolina, but I grew up in Mexico. \[I’m\] double majoring in human organizational leadership development and Hispanic studies with a minor in translating and interpreting.

(Daniel)

Hi, my name is Danny Simon. I’m from Wake Forest, North Carolina, and I’m a double major in economics and potentially math with a minor in either business or data science.

(Allyson)

Describe the moment you received the Morehead-Cain. Where were you, and what was your reaction?

(Christopher)

So, I have a pretty funny story for that, actually. I was in a Bojangles, and it was in the Bojangles on campus, and I was eating lunch with my roommate. And I was really worried already because I heard it was coming out that day, so I kept refreshing my email, seeing if there was anything there. And then all of a sudden, I get an email, and I read it. And it doesn’t actually sound like an acceptance email at first because the first sentence was almost like they’re congratulating me, but not exactly. But then I read more intensely to it, and I realized I was accepted. And then I started crying in the middle of the Bojangles. And I bet a lot of people thought that was probably like the lowest point of my life because who really cries in a Bojangles? But I thought it was pretty funny.

(Mary)

I learned that I received the Morehead-Cain Scholarship when I was in my dorm, I got an email, and the first gut reaction that I had was to call my parents and told them that we did it.

(Daniel)

I was in my dorm room in Morrison. I was taking a nap. And funnily enough, I had a dream. And in that dream, I got an email, and I got the scholarship. So, then I woke up from the dream. I was like, man, that would be really nice. So, I checked my phone, and I had an email. My roommate was in the room. So, I grabbed my phone, went outside, and was just kind of sitting on the balcony. And then I read it, and I was pretty emotional. I kind of sat down and took a couple of moments to breathe in. It meant a lot, and it felt a lot.

(Kassandra)

My first reaction was to scream. And then I called my mom, and I was like, “Mom, guess what?” This conversation is happening in Spanish as well. And I was like, “I got it.” And she was like, “I knew you would.” She’s my biggest supporter. I’m my biggest hater. So, there’s like a balance between us. She’s always telling me, “You can do it.” And then there’s me, always ready for the worst-case scenario.

(Allyson)

What activities or organizations are you part of at UNC and the surrounding community?

(Mary)

At UNC, I am in the cypher club. That’s more just like a freestyle rap club, very informal. I don’t do it myself, but I enjoy going to all the club meetings on Wednesdays in the Pit. In terms of the surrounding community, I wouldn’t say I belong to any particular organization. I do have a crochet business and a financial literacy educational platform that I manage, and those take up a lot of my time.

(Daniel)

The club that I’m most involved with right now is called Alpha. Stands for the Association of Latino Professionals for America. And we focus on providing networking and skill-building opportunities for Latino students, especially those interested in going into any business-y areas, but also into some nonprofit and NGO work. I’m also very involved with PORCH Communities. I’ve interned with them twice in the past year since I got to campus, focusing on food security work with this food drive organization. And lastly, I’m supposed to start working with the Department of Food and Nutrition Services of North Carolina.

(Christopher)

Main things right now on UNC campus are CS + Social Good club. I’m the education lead for that. So basically, I’m teaching like full stack web development to a class of, I think we had like 130 people that are attending the class or participating in the class. And then another thing is the TechX Society, that’s another organization on campus for computer science. There, I’m also the education lead. Technically, it’s called the “headmaster” at that club. And there I’m teaching more about, also a little bit more advanced full stack development stuff, but also how to think like a startup and how to make your projects into startups.

(Kassandra)

So right now, I’m the secretary of AMEXCAN, the first association of Mexicans at UNC. We’re a chapter under a Mexican-incorporated and nonprofit organization based in ECU. And our main goal is to spread awareness about volunteerism and opportunities in the Mexican community. And also, we welcome allies and other people that are interested in the heritage and culture of Mexico. I have a work study position at the Institute for the Study of the Americas, and I’m a BIC collaborator, which stands for “building integrated communities.” And I’m also part of the collaborative of the Language Access Collaborative. And I help mainly with translating and communication specialists, media assistant. Last week, I attended a council meeting for the Hispanic and Latinx affairs for the governor’s office. And that was pretty wholesome just to be in a space surrounded other people and leaders from the community, the Hispanic community as well.

(Allyson)

Had you heard of the Morehead-Cain Program before you were invited to apply?

(Daniel)

So I have. I first applied to this Program in high school. I remember the first time I heard about it. I was visiting family in Costa Rica, and I was pretty, just kind of awestruck by the incredible opportunities that the Program afforded. So, in high school, I was pretty dead set on applying, and I made it all the way to the finalist round as a high school senior.

(Kassandra)

I moved here my junior year of high school. So, I finished high school here. And then, in my senior year, I remember that my high school ran a process to select the school nominee, and my ESL teacher, Ursula Goldston, whom I love, mentioned, like, oh, you should apply. And then I applied to be the school nominee, but then I was not the nominee. And then, the counselor talked about self-nomination. But I was going through a lot, still adapting from moving from another country and learning the language and kind of getting all the credit requirements to graduate high school. So, I did not apply, but I knew about the Program kind of like a little bit, not much about their goals or their purpose, but I knew that it was a full ride and that it offered really good experiences. And that was all the information that I had about Morehead-Cain.

(Christopher)

I heard about it a little bit, not too intensely, though. I didn’t really know what they offered. I just knew that it was like a full-ride scholarship. And that’s basically the extent of it. I didn’t know anyone part of the Morehead-Cain Scholarship, like, I heard of people part of it, but I didn’t know anyone personally.

(Allyson)

How has the Morehead-Cain Program impacted your life?

(Mary)

So I’ve only been a scholar for a couple of months, but it’s already made a huge, tremendous positive impact, I would say. Now, I feel like I have a smaller community within UNC. As someone who didn’t come in as part of a community or, a club or an organization. I feel like I have a group of people now that I trust and who are friendly to me, and it’s just really incredible to have that on campus. I’m also super excited to study abroad this summer and to also take advantage of the Global Perspective \[summer\].

(Christopher)

I think the connections are probably one of the biggest things that I’ve gotten out of it. I’ve already gotten, actually an internship that I’m currently doing right now as a software engineer at Well, which is a health tech company on Franklin Street. And that was something that Morehead-Cain totally helped me out with, connecting me with because I just wanted to earn a little extra money while also doing professional development.

(Kassandra)

Coming as a freshman, building my community, creating bonds with friends and with other students was kind of complicated. And one of the biggest changes that the Morehead-Cain has given me is friends because now some of my closest friends are also intakes or scholars from other classes. So, I will say that’s one of the biggest changes that the Program has given me.

(Allyson)

What are you most excited for as a Morehead-Cain Scholar?

(Daniel)

I mean, obviously, the summer experiences are wild, but one of the things that’s really excited me is the network. There’s a ton of people doing a ton of really, really cool work, and I’m excited to get to reach out to them and learn from everything that they’ve done and see how that can shape what I want to do and go into.

(Christopher)

Definitely excited for the summers. I’m excited for that. I think it’s going to be pretty cool to see what I can learn and also just kind of the connections I’m going to be able to make. I’m excited this summer I’m doing Civic Collaboration. So, it’s going to be really cool one to get to meet and know the class of 2027, but also on top of that, be able to make a lot of connections. That’s why I’m hoping to at least make some connections in the startup space or just, in general, the tech space. Also, on top of that, I’m probably going to be taking a stop-out year eventually. So that’s another exciting thing that Morehead-Cain is helping me out with. I’m trying to plan it out with some of the advisors, and there I’m going to hopefully just be on the West Coast just trying to do a bunch of startup stuff. I’m excited for that because that’s kind of an opportunity that I didn’t really think I would be able to have in the safety of, like, yeah, I’m still able to return to college afterwards, which is very cool.

(Kassandra)

I’m excited about our \[Outdoor Leadership\] hiking trip to Utah. I’m kind of terrified, to be honest, but still, it’s a challenge, and I’m always ready for a new challenge, and I’m not another person. So that’s why I’m excited, because something that I like is just to keep that piece of excitement, just to keep doing something different every single time that I can. And I know that it’s going to be like a bonding experience with my cohort.

(Allyson)

Is there a particular summer experience that you’re most excited for?

(Mary)

There is. I am so excited for the Global Perspective summer. I’ve decided to do it this summer after my sophomore year, and I’m hoping to go to Japan and study different meditation practices under the theme of mindfulness and reflection. And then my deliverable would be chapters of a memoir.

(Kassandra)

I’m excited about Civic Collaboration, about social service, and everything, but I’m also excited about Global Perspective because Morehead-Cain has given me the opportunity to explore other things that I would not have the opportunity if it wasn’t for Morehead-Cain. Firstly, because financial constraints—I‘m a daughter of immigrant parents, they have worked really hard, but still I don’t have anything settled. So having this opportunity to explore different cultures and perspectives, it’s something that really interests me, especially with my major hold and just kind of like see leadership around the world.

(Allyson)

What advice can you give for current UNC freshmen interested in the Sophomore Selection process?

(Daniel)

Looking back, I kind of did everything I did, not really knowing that this was an existing program, so it’s kind of hard to say that there was anything that really was important. If it’s going to continue to be a nomination process, I’d obviously encourage you to get to know your professors. But beyond just for the Sophomore Selection process, I’ve really enjoyed getting to know my professors, so I’d encourage you to do it no matter what. They’re ridiculously interesting people who are doing all sorts of interesting research, and at the very least, they’re fun to talk to.

This is funny because everyone keeps telling you, “Just be yourself.” But that’s the true answer. Just be genuine. Don’t try to pretend to be someone you are not, and that will speak for yourself when you are writing your application. Later on, when you’re doing your interview with the alumni and doing all the activities that you have throughout as a finalist. Be genuine. Don’t try to be someone else.

What has been your favorite Carolina memory?

(Daniel)

One of my favorite Carolina memories has been going to the Old Well the very first time I went for my first day of class, my roommate and I set an alarm for 3:30 a.m. And then biked over to the Well. And it was just us and two other people, two nursing students, who had the same awful idea. It was raining, it was windy, it was altogether kind of an awful night. But going to the well, just kind of on a whim in the middle of the night, on our own, was a really cool experience. I think it’s something that I’ll cherish forever. And then rushing Franklin Street last week was pretty awesome, too.

(Mary)

My favorite Carolina memory has probably been every Wednesday, the UNC Cipher Club gathers in the Pit area, and we turn on the speakers, people play their beats, and then people hop on free styling. I’ve never actually hopped on the mic, but honestly, it’s just everybody’s welcome, which makes it even better. There are no invitations, no nothing. But there are some regulars. I’m a regular, and so it’s just been an incredible way to meet super-talented people.

(Christopher)

Honestly, I’d probably say when I got accepted into the Scholarship, I felt like it was kind of a culmination of a lot of my experiences here that I’ve went through, and its kind of all hit me at once. I’m very much like a person that I feel like I always have to be doing more. And a lot of times I don’t take what I do as the accomplishment. In general, I feel like I just always have to keep pushing forward. But to have the recognition for what I have done and kind of have that as the culmination of everything that I’ve experienced at UNC.

(Kassandra)

I feel like some people will say it’s like rushing Franklin, but mine actually was rushing Keenan Stadium field. When we beat Duke during the football season last semester, I was with great company—friends that I can now call essential parts of my life, and that I kind of like having this sense of unity in Carolina after what happened last semester where we lost a life and then kind of like recovering the sense of community and unity that represents Carolina. And that’s something that I still remember, like, oh, my God, beating Duke and then kind of like sports, unifying us as a single community and just being there, supporting each other and being so excited and tripping because you wanted to get there so fast, but still you felt like you were not moving. And then you got there, and it was just like, \[mimics screaming\], so just being with everyone there and kind of like knowing that Carolina is part of our identity. It’s part of who we are, not only as students, but then as, like, student leaders, and then as part of this amazing community.

# Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program Spotlight, with Emily Howard ’00 and Kayden Hunt ’24: Pursuing meaning and connection over achievement
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

Emily Howard ’00

In the [Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/topics/17692/page/overview), alumni and scholars create meaningful connections that go far beyond career talk.

For Emily Howard ’00 and Kayden Hunt ’24, their mentorship became a lifeline during the pandemic.

The two were initially matched in 2020 based on their shared interests in journalism. (In the program, mentors are matched with mentees based on a combination of factors, including shared interests, career goals, and personal backgrounds, among other preferences scholars may list during the application process.)

Emily is a senior associate editor at [Thomson Reuters Practical Law](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/practical-law), while Kayden is an aspiring photojournalist at the [UNC Hussman School of Journalism and Media](http://hussman.unc.edu/).

With much of the world shut down from the pandemic, conversations prioritized mental health over strictly career-related topics.

“We talked a lot about managing the situations we were in, and we held each other accountable to make sure we addressed the challenges we were facing at the time,” the alumna said.

“It felt nice for both of us to have someone we could check in with during a tough situation, and she was just as helpful for me, if not more helpful, than I may have been to her.”

For Emily, sharing different perspectives is far more valuable than simply giving advice. That way, both sides benefit.

“Reflecting on some of my experiences from college and being a sounding board for Kayden is how I’m most able to be helpful as a mentor,” she said.

One thing she’s encouraged Kayden to do, in a now fully opened campus, is to take advantage of office hours and develop authentic relationships with professors.

Joining the Carolina community from a small town felt daunting as a high school senior, said the alumna, a native of Graham, North Carolina. The realization came later that most professors want to engage deeply with students one-on-one.

“I went to a tiny high school and was very intimidated by academics,” said Emily, who was nominated for the Morehead-Cain by Graham High School. “I wish someone had told me that I should’ve felt comfortable getting to know professors.”

Meaning over achievement

The mentoring pair has also talked about building flourishing lives as opposed to career trajectories alone.

For Emily, a desire for flexibility to spend more time with family informed her decision to switch from practicing law to a law-adjacent job in legal writing.

“I’m first and foremost a mother, and I wasn’t able to have the hands-on level of involvement that I wanted with my kids in Big Law,” she said.

For more than a decade, she climbed the ranks at four different law firms in New York City before joining Thomson Reuters. In her current role, she researches and writes articles that assist attorneys in their practice areas.

Emily hopes her conversations with Kayden allow space for her to imagine careers that focus on meaning over achievement.

“I want to make sure she does something she really enjoys, and not just something that she thinks is expected of her as a high achiever because she’s a Morehead-Cain Scholar,” she said.

Since adjusting her career path in law, Emily launched a floral startup that she managed for years, got back into photography, and regained flexibility to spend more time with her small kids.

Learning across generations

What began as a mentorship with Kayden has developed into a friendship, Emily said, where each person supports the other. As a mentor, alumni can learn as much from their mentees as the scholars learn from them.

“It feels good to help a young person who has all the intelligence but perhaps not as much of the wisdom that comes from being out in the world for however long,” she said.

Emily and Kayden have participated in the program for two years as a pair and plan to continue informally for years to come.

“We all have that curiosity to learn about how younger generations think, how they’re navigating the world, and it’s been great to have found a friend in Kayden and to learn from her perspective.”

Connect with a mentor

The [Morehead-Cain Mentoring Program](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/topics/17692/page/overview) is designed to leverage the power of the Morehead-Cain network by cultivating connections between scholars and alumni, and providing structure and support to these relationships so they can develop based on shared values and interests. All rising juniors and seniors are eligible to participate in the one-year program.

# Scholar cohort completes year-long Dialogue & Discourse program
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

The Dialogue and Discourse program finished with a retreat at the Rizzo Center in Chapel Hill from March 22 to March 24.

The inaugural Dialogue and Discourse experience for junior and senior scholars concluded in March. The year-long program was designed to build capacity for leadership and communication on complex issues.

Launched last fall, the program was led by Bill Isaacs and Skip Griffin of [Dialogos](https://www.dialogos.com/), a strategic dialogue and leadership development consulting firm.

Nigel Parker ’25 said the program strengthened him through a “practice of self reflection.”

“My experience has inspired me to deepen my relationships with myself, my fellow scholars, and my community at large,” he said. “I am grateful for the wisdom of the scholars who experienced this program with me, as well as for Skip and Bill for facilitating and guiding this special group.”

For Roariker Swenson ’25, Dialogue and Discourse grew his understanding of the “power of deep empathy in disagreement.”

“We often forget that, during most arguments, we both have the same end goal and simply envision different paths to its successful achievement,” the junior said. “As someone who studies Chinese and Russian, and who wants to build a career around building bridges and deepening cross-cultural understanding, this experience has been profound in helping me shape new strategies and frameworks for peace building.”

Morehead-Cain is grateful to the alumni who supported the Dialogue and Discourse program.

# Introducing the new sophomores in the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026
[Back to Blog](index-4.html "Back to Blog")

The Morehead-Cain Foundation is pleased to announce the first cohort to join the Program as part of its [Sophomore Selection initiative](https://www.moreheadcain.org/sophomoreintake/). The students—all sophomores attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill—will join the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026 and will be introduced as Morehead-Cain Scholars at the Foundation’s Fall Banquet on November 16, 2023.

The fifteen scholars come from five North Carolina counties, six states, and China. Their fields of study at Carolina include statistics, computer science, biology, neuroscience, business, history, political science, and education.

Morehead-Cain launched the Sophomore Selection Initiative in September 2023 to identify a small cohort of current sophomores at UNC–Chapel Hill who have demonstrated exceptional scholarship, leadership, and character and invite them to join the Morehead-Cain Program as members of the Morehead-Cain Class of 2026.

The process of selecting the cohort involves an extensive application review and participation in a Final Selection Experience assessed by members of the Morehead-Cain Central Selection Committee. Candidates enter the process via nomination from a wide array of individuals on campus, including professors, department heads, teaching assistants, and staff of scholarship, service, extracurricular, and cultural programs. Transfer students are eligible through partnerships with the North Carolina Community College System and UNC Office of Undergraduate Admissions.

The new scholars join a thriving community of thinkers, leaders, creators, and adventurers at UNC–Chapel Hill, who are empowered to set their potential free. Scholars gain access to a network of peers and mentors, summer enrichment programming, advising, Lovelace Fund for Discovery, funded study abroad, and a living stipend.

The Sophomore Selection Initiative allows Morehead-Cain to “accelerate the journey” of exceptional students who demonstrated their capacity for leadership in their first year at Carolina, according to Morehead-Cain President Chris Bradford.

“UNC­–Chapel Hill is full of emerging leaders with wide-ranging interests and aspirations. We are honored to invest in that potential by offering opportunities to pursue global experiences, design research projects, and access impactful internships,” Bradford said. “The Sophomore Selection Initiative gives Morehead-Cain the opportunity to identify more emerging leaders and offer more transformational experiences to Carolina students who will shape this campus and the world.”

Since its founding in 1945, the Morehead-Cain Program has been a model for countless merit scholarships throughout the United States. These include the University of Virginia’s Jefferson Scholars Program, Duke University’s Benjamin N. Duke Scholars Program, and Emory University’s Woodruff Scholars Program.

High-resolution images of the Morehead-Cain Scholars can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I-QLRWkcvu7Ms04m_81uL6h61GGyQGG6). A biography of each scholar is below.

## Episode transcription

(Taylor Shinal ’25)

Hey, guys, it’s Taylor Shinal, Class of 2025. I’m reporting in from Serengeti, Tanzania, here with a few other scholars and some people that I’ve met along the gap year.

We are currently in a parked safari car waiting for about a 1,000 wildebeests to cross the road ahead of us. The Great \[Wildebeest\] Migration is going on right now, so that’s been really incredible to witness. And we’ve also seen tons of other incredible forms of wildlife, like giraffes, hippos. We’ve come essentially face-to-face with multiple lions today, which was pretty insane. And tomorrow, we move on to the Ngorongoro Crater to continue exploring, so super excited for that.

(Sarah)

Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Sarah O’Carroll. This week, we have a special segment featuring the gap year. We’ll first hear from Emile Charles from the Class of 2024, who shares what it was like to be on a gap year disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. He first told this story in Pecha Kucha-style during our Virtual Final Selection Weekend to an audience of Morehead-Cain finalists. We also asked our current gap year scholars to give us some quick takes of what life looks like for them right now as they’re scattered throughout the world. Just as you heard at the beginning from Taylor, you’ll hear from a couple others at the end of the episode, accompanied with music by Nicholas Byrne from the Class of 2019, who is also our next guest on Catalyze.

OK, here’s Emile.

(Emile)

When I first got to Cape Town, I had no idea where to fit in. I had a hospital intern job, but often got out early and had entire afternoons off.

I left home looking for change, and now, during the city’s vibrant spring, I felt filled with new life. I was realizing that a year abroad meant more than just time away from home; it was space to think about who I was and who I wanted to grow into.

I learned that, at first, growth is small. While not all that great, cashew-chicken stir fry was the first meal I felt good about. From there, my cooking skills grew easily, but at other times, this growth felt hard. I was navigating language, cultural, and racial barriers, forcing my way across some and not being sure how to get through others.

At the hospital, I wasn’t given much of an orientation, plopped in with students years ahead of me. I was often assumed to be of Colored descent or to translate from Zulu or Xhosa I did not know. I got real-life experiences as the liaison between doctors, children, and families and began to build my foundation skills in public health.

My learning consisted of a lot of medicine, mainly bones, joints, and chronic pains, but what wasn’t all. I learned how to enjoy my personal time, too, getting the best sleep of my life, catching up with new and old friends, and falling endlessly into great books.

I celebrated South Africa’s Rugby World Cup win, something that hadn’t happened in over 20 years. On the day of, I borrowed a friend’s protea shirt and wore the country’s national flower proudly.

Continuing to meet people, I made sure to take down names and numbers. This helped: I caught invites to weekends away and even family vacations. The most beautiful of these was to the West Coast National Park, finding myself in a kayak on a white sand beach with flamingos I didn’t know existed in this part of the world.

My time in South Africa also offered me space for cultural and historical learning. I spent time in Johannesburg, visiting the Constitutional Court and Apartheid Museum. There was a reckoning that had seemed to occur; the evidence was everywhere. Things weren’t perfect, but I still came to a better understanding where I was and what this incredible place had to show the world.

Coming home for just a month, I squeezed in a trip to my father’s Caribbean home. I connected with deep roots that had been sleeping for too long, but these seemed to wake right up with roadside corn and daily breakfast plantains. I felt stronger in my identities but was still spun around by the diversity of the globe.

The few weeks in Grenada were amazing. It was warm, calm, and felt like a home that missed me, too. I took trips to some of my Dad’s childhood sites, his mother’s grave, and the fruit farm he’d managed for as long as I can remember. I learned how to be back with family and now live with my new life experiences. I planned to leave in a few weeks for Malawi and wasn’t quite sure how to prepare.

Back across the Atlantic and, at times, with junior Morehead-Cain Scholar Sita Tayal, I started yet another new routine. I was working at UNC Project Malawi, a global health collaboration between UNC-Chapel Hill and the Malawi Ministry of Health.

I lived with people from not only Malawi, but around the world, too, from Kenya, the Netherlands, India, and Italy. Again, I could see global public health systems in the works and got to engage with them fully.

Unfortunately, my time was cut short, and I was forced to leave Malawi early with unresolved feelings and friendships. Though, despite my early departure, the most important part of a gap year still happened – a crazy hair decision. During the last night before my flight, I spontaneously got dreadlocks and when my Dad picked me up, he barely recognized me.

I felt it was more than just my hair that had changed.

At home, I tried to stay plugged in as things shut down, but instead, I was forced to brood inside with depressing news as a constant background. The public health nightmare didn’t seem real, and I knew that all my spaces of months past had drastically changed. I was stuck at home as the pandemic continued to rage and the country’s tensions further boiled.

On May 25, I remember hearing George Floyd’s name for the first time. In the days after, I attended protests in Raleigh and Durham. It didn’t seem like Chapel Hill was rallying so I decided to. And on June 3, I helped fill the streets with people and their voices.

The organizing work came about organically, but I soon realized that if I was the one creating the flyers and demanding change, I had to follow through with the harder work, too.

My activism continued, filling the rest of my summer and introducing me to even new ideas and parts of myself. As I settled on my UNC-Chapel Hill fall plans, I realized there was a world in which I hadn’t done all the things I did over the last year. I never expected myself to be in a South African hospital, on an international health team, or at the front of a march, but my year off had given me time for all of it.

Now, looking back on my gap year and forward to the rest of my time in college, I still feel amazed. I recognize that there is immense potential and opportunity, and when fully supported by the Morehead-Cain Foundation, this only becomes more profound.

But, before I can even speak on the actual four years in the Program, it was during my time before my passion and skills were truly developed.

After my first week in Cape Town, I wrote the following for a Morehead-Cain reflection: “This past week is certainly the start of a journey and I am continuously learning things throughout. All of these lessons are shaping my experiences and the more I learn, the more I am able to find and be at home.”

I chose to take a gap year to learn and think about myself deeply, to take a break from the whirlwind of school and pressures of traditional education. I urge you all, too, to think about how and why you should grow. How can you develop into the person you want to be? What do you need to push you?

If you’re anything like me, an international gap year might just be the answer.

(Sarah)

Thank you for listening to Catalyze. I’m Sarah O’Carroll, and that was Emile Charles from the Class of 24. To finish out the episode, here are a few more messages from our current gap year scholars.

(Mark Finamore ’25)

As I walk up and down the aisles of Ljubljana’s Sunday market, I trace the same footsteps my grandmother paved over 80 years ago as a little girl. As I glance around, I see fresh Slovenian sausage being stuffed behind one stand by the local butcher, a sight contrasted by the succulent aromas of apple and cherry strudel being sold by a neighboring merchant.

The buzz of negotiating customers is cut by a loud DING, DONG, which rings through the city. Squinting into the distance, I see the clock tower, then, the cathedral just across the river, where my grandmother grew up attending mass, and just besides that is her preschool where she went for kindergarten. “Wow,” I think to myself, “What a beautiful life she lived just before the war.”

(Taylor Shinal ’25)

I’m reporting in here from the pyramids of Giza in Egypt, so we’re about 60 meters underground at the moment in the Tomb of Khafre. We had to climb a few tunnels to get down here. The air is quite thin, and it is way hotter than it is outside. That’s been really cool, though, to be inside of a structure that was built nearly 4500 years ago.

Also, standing outside of the pyramids, it’s hard to explain how absolutely gigantic these structures are. They’re about 500-feet tall and every single block that they’re made of is almost as tall as I am. So, pretty remarkable. Definitely understanding why this is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

(Asher Wexler ’25)

This is Asher. I’m at Lossiemouth Beach right now in Scotland. The North Sea is nuking – we’ve got seven footers, the biggest I’ve ever seen it. Water temperature is around 40 degrees, so I’ve got my wet suit on.

“Hi, Gus! Hey, how are you, man?” That was Gus, he is a paddle boarder that I met a couple weeks ago.

After the surf this morning, I’m going to head back home, and around 10 a.m., I’ll be driving to a farm to interview a client about the noise pollution problems he’s having.

(Noah Gottlieb ’25)

This is Noah Gottlieb ’25, and I’m currently standing at the top of Park City’s highest ski slope. This being my first time skiing out West, I’m mentally preparing myself for a successful descent. Fingers crossed.

All right. Well, I’m going to gaze out at these breathtaking, snowcapped mountains spread before me one last time, take one more frosty breath in through my nose, and push myself over the ridge.

## Episode transcription

(Allyson)

Nandini, thank you for joining us today. I first met you at Discovery Weekend just about a year ago. What ultimately drew you to Carolina, and what factors did you consider?

(Nandini)

I grew up not too far from here. I grew up in Cary. UNC-Chapel Hill has very much been a part of my childhood, coming here on the weekends with family or knowing friends who went here. It just felt nice to have a place that felt so familiar but also would give me enough of an opportunity and, I guess, distance, per se, from home that I could develop and grow independently. Also, it’s just an amazing school and an amazing place for me to pursue what I’m interested in career-wise. I’m, for now, let’s say, interested in something in the healthcare field. UNC has a great ecosystem for that, so I’m very lucky.

(Allyson)

Yeah, amazing. And then just last year in high school, you were heavily involved in the Future Health Professionals, which is also known as HOSA, as well as policymaking in your hometown. How are you continuing to blend your background in policymaking and science through your academics and extracurriculars at Carolina?

(Nandini)

Yeah, definitely. So, I’m a double major in neuroscience and public policy here. So I’ve been very fortunate to be in a lot of classes where I’ve been able to mold my interests together, like in my public policy classes, when we would get the opportunity to write briefs on a topic that we’re interested in. So last semester, I spent heavily researching a topic that’s very close to my heart and that I’m very passionate about, which is mental health access and equity, and I wrote a policy brief, actually, about how a lot of states in the U.S. don’t really give children adequate mental health care, and how that’s actually leading to a lot of human rights violations in the states, which a lot of people don’t know about. And so, it’s really given me the opportunity, and UNC makes it easy, also being a liberal arts school, for me to be able to blend those interests together.

(Allyson)

Yeah, and I think we were in the same policy class last semester. I remember your presentation, and it was so in-depth. How did you get drawn to that topic specifically?

(Nandini)

Actually, in high school, I was on the debate team, and we had this one topic about mental health equity and how insurance companies are constantly evading paying for mental health care. While I researched that, I found this interesting article about how in Illinois, there were parents who were giving up custody of their child to the state just so their child could get mental health care. Because when you become a foster kid of the state, North Carolina is mandated to provide and cover all your health care costs. That’s something that’s happening in 21 states across the US. The last time the government wrote a report about it was in 2003. I thought that was interesting because it’s a huge, huge problem, and no one’s talking about it. The one article I found from a national source was NPR in 2019. I got lucky coming across that article, reached out to the reporter, and just did more research on it. Then throughout high school and in my first semester, leading into the second semester here at Carolina, I really delved into that topic, talked to more stakeholders, and was trying to understand what exactly was going on.

(Allyson)

Wow, that’s amazing. No, I honestly did not know any of that information at all now until you said that. But on the topic of public health and access to medical devices: Sensible, which is the organization that you co-founded and lead as CEO. When did you start thinking of this specific issue, and how did that cultivate into Sensible?

(Nandini)

It was inspired by personal experiences, but also circumstance allowed for Sensible to become what it is. I’ll start at the beginning. I was part of HOSA in high school, which was a really great opportunity for me to engage in a career field that I was interested in. One of the competitive events for the organization was called Medical Innovation. A couple of my friends and I teamed up for that, and we had to come up with this hypothetical medical device or innovation. We were thinking on this like, what is a problem that’s really close to our heart and what’s something that we could come up with? A lot of us had a lot of shared experiences with periods and our menstrual health, a lot of experiences in our culture where we felt almost ostracized while we were on our periods. For example, me, myself, I’m a Hindu. That’s the religion my family practices. And part of that, when I’m on my period, I’m not allowed to go to the temple or go into certain rooms in the house because I’m considered “unclean” or “dirty.” And this was a sentiment that a lot of my friends also experienced in their houses.

But we had never talked about it. I’d never had a conversation with any of my friends about it until we were in a room trying to think of a problem to solve, and we were really getting deep about it. But for something that’s such a shared experience among millions, almost thousands of people around the world, no one was talking about it, and we were like, how do we address this issue? In that research, we also came across the fact that in a lot of underdeveloped, underserved areas, that disease incidents rates were extremely high. Naturally, that was because these areas didn’t have the capital to subsidize health care facilities or professionals like doctors that could serve those areas, take care of them, those populations. Combining those two things, we came up with Sensible, which is a diagnostic menstrual pad aimed at screening for cervical diseases in underserved populations. Our concept was, what’s the singular way your bodies expel blood naturally? You don’t need to poke a needle, draw blood, send it to a lab, get it processed. The one way your body expels blood naturally is menstruation. Why aren’t we taking advantage of that more?

We were like, what if we could create a device that while you’re on your period, it collects the blood, processes it, and spits out a result for whether or not you’re positive for, and our initial use case is cervical cancer, so that’s what we’re screening for, so whether or not you’re at risk for cervical cancer. That was the concept. It’s very similar to when you were during the pandemic, when you would have to take a COVID test at home, it’s a very similar technology to that. In minutes, you’d be able to know. Our concept was making diagnostics cheaper. Our device has the potential to screen for something at $5 or less compared to a $300 a pap smear. Our concept was just making health care more accessible and, in the process, be able to destigmatize menstruation by associating it with a life-saving construct. So, tackling two problems at once.

(Allyson)

That is amazing. I never would have thought of the naturally dispelling blood and using that in that sense. That is wow. I can’t believe you guys came up with that in high school at that. That is fascinating.

(Nandini)

Thank you.

(Allyson)

But on that same note, you were saying you co-founded it with your fellow high school mates. And so, is your team expanding today, or who makes up that team in general?

(Nandini)

Yeah. So originally the team started with four people, including myself. And then after that, a couple of people graduated, and then the team structure changed a lot. And down the line, we had to recruit more to sustain operations. So, we went to… Our first source of people were underclass men at our high school. So, we recruited who are current COO and CTO are. After that, we needed more and more manpower. We recruited our first class of interns this past fall. Our team currently consists of 15 people with both executive and interns. We have people with talents from all over the place. We have people who are really well-versed in marketing and promotion, people who are very well-versed in research skills and product development, finances. It’s important to me and my team that we have a diverse set of perspectives and skills on the team. And with a product like this, it was also very important to get people from different cultures and different ways of life because when you think about a topic like menstruation, for something that’s so stigmatized, it’s stigmatized in different ways for different communities. So, if we really want to address the problem at its core and do so properly, we want to make sure that the minds behind it are contributing to those ideas and making sure that we really are addressing the problem in every way possible.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And this is a massive undertaking of just addressing this issue entirely as well as managing this many people. So, what obstacles have you faced while doing this?

(Nandini)

Yeah. So naturally, anytime you work with a group of people, people you bring on to your team, it’s not always going to work out. And I think in the day and age that we live in today, it’s very easy to get interested in a lot of things. So, people who are very passionate about a project for six months may not retain that kind of passion six months later. As a leader and working with a team like this, it’s very important to distill that passion or re-instill that passion in team members. So, I think for me, it’s important to give team members a lot of autonomy. I think a lot of times it’s very easy to tell and then they just do, but to make people really invested in the project, and the reason they were brought onto the team in the first place is because they were passionate about this idea. So, to give them a stake in the game and be like, “Hey, if you have any ideas, I would love to hear them, and let’s make them happen.” Just making people excited, really, every day about what they’re working on, and then just allowing them to explore themselves, learn, and grow at the same time. Because me, too, I’m also learning and growing. So, it’s very important that they’re also doing the same.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And so, you’re CEO of Sensible. So, what does that role entail for you?

(Nandini)

So a big part of it is meeting people, making connections, and providing a vision and direction for Sensible. I have some amazing, very, very talented team members who handle operations and product development and are very, very well-versed in very niche areas, but are also very good at handling a lot of other tasks. And so, for me, it’s just making sure everything fits together, like the puzzle pieces really do go together, and that everyone’s on top of their game, and that we are growing, not just working in a stagnated space, but just making sure we’re growing, and people know who we are. And as CEO, it’s just providing the vision, I think I’d like to say.

(Allyson)

Yeah, that’s amazing, especially as a first year, having all this experience on your belt. I can’t even imagine how impactful that is just for you and your future experiences. Truly amazing. And then you are filing for a patent, right? Or are you patent pending for Sensible?

(Nandini)

We are patent pending. We’ve already filed. So thankfully, we’re just waiting now. It’ll take a hot minute.

(Allyson)

How was that journey of filing that patent for you? Have you ever done that before?

(Nandini)

I’ve never done it before. We did file a provisional about a year ago, so I went through somewhat of a similar process. But for the first time, I’ve never done anything this intense of an undertaking. I had some very amazing team members who had done something similar and worked a lot on it. But for me, it was something entirely new. We had a grant that we won about a year and a half ago from Lemelson–MIT, up in Boston. They provided us a pro bono IP agent, Shirley Fung, amazing Akona IP \[Law Firm\], plug in that. But she was very, very helpful in educating us about the process and how when you’re trying to file for IP, the idea must be novel. But there’s still ways that you can deviate from this extinct technology, protect yourself. That’s very important working in a space like this. When you’re talking about something very passionately, a lot of people take advantage of that. So, make sure that you’re protected. We just had very amazing people educate us about the process and hold our hand throughout the whole thing. And so, we got very lucky with that.

(Allyson)

And you were just talking about that grant, and that grant was just a little under $8,000, right?

(Nandini)

Yeah, $7,500.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And what did that grant mean to you, not only as an inventor, but a female inventer for this very specific topic that you feel very passionately about?

(Nandini)

It felt amazing. I think it was really the first in a series of validations that we were on the right path and that we were really doing something very meaningful to have an organization like that back you and invest in you and be like, “Hey, we believe in this idea,” and provide us not only just money, but resources and mentors. We had a very amazing mentor, Dr. Esther Brooks, an amazing individual who would check in on us every week. If we needed to connect with somebody at different universities who are very much experts in this field, she wouldn’t hesitate to make those connections happen. When we would make mistakes, she would call us out on it. She really was somebody who guided us through the process. And throughout that journey, she really made us both experience… Let us know that as female inventors working on a project that is so stigmatized, she helped us understand how to balance that stigma. For me, for example, when you’re talking about a topic that a lot of other people feel uncomfortable about, there are moments where at a couple of presentations, people would be like, don’t put that image on your slideshow. It would be a picture of a uterus bleeding or something. It was like a clip art. It wasn’t even a real image, but they’d be like, “It’s too raw. We don’t want to see that. It’ll make the audience uncomfortable.” And I’m like, “How else are we supposed to explain what we’re doing?” Menstruation is a very real process. And to explain what Sensible is, we need to talk about that context. She would help us balance the, don’t throw it all at them at once because a lot of people get scared. But at the same time, don’t hide what you’re trying to say because you were talking about very important, very real things. It sucks that sometimes you have to do that. You have to play that balancing act. But she guided us through the process of teaching us how to really educate the public in a productive way.

(Allyson)

This sounds like a massive responsibility and a lot of experience going into this. You’re a first-year student, so how do you manage Sensible, along with other extracurriculars, along with academics? How do you do all this?

(Nandini)

I’m not even going to lie. I feel like I don’t. But to be honest, first semester was hard because college was very new for me. I was trying to learn college, trying to learn adulthood, and keep up with stuff that I was already doing, Sensible being one of those things. I took some time in the beginning. I think one thing that’s very important, I think a lot of people feel afraid to do this, is to say, “Hey, I need some time. I need some time for myself so that I can come back and work on this project in a much stronger space.” And I definitely struggle with that. I’m not going to lie, the first few weeks of college were hard keeping up with Sensible and keeping up with classes, learning this new system of life. But I think it’s very important. Because if you yourself are not operating in the way, you’re not in your top shape, then you can’t really offer what you had the potential to offer to your team or to whatever initiative you’re taking under. So, whether it’s a couple of days a week, sometimes it’s nice to step away and be like, take that space, recoup, rejuvenate, and then come back even stronger. I didn’t really learn that before. That’s something that I didn’t really know, and I learned, and I’m very grateful for. I think it’s made me even more capable of working on this project.

(Allyson)

For sure. Just a little mental break and you come back 10 times better. I feel the same exact way. But for aspiring entrepreneurs, do you have any advice you can give them for balancing in life and work as well as just extracurriculars?

(Nandini)

Yeah. As an entrepreneur, it’s very important to… Because a lot of times when you’re especially starting out, you’re not working on your own time, you’re working on somebody else’s time. You’re trying to meet people, get their advice, get their mentorship, and they have a schedule that’s already set. You’re the one that needs to change things around. It’s important to just be flexible, I think it’s very… And really be on time for things, be on top of it, and just talk to as many people as you can. I think that’s my biggest advice. Don’t ever be afraid to take a risk because as we’ve heard the very famous quote, “You miss 100% of the chances you never take.” I very much live by that. It’s like, when someone says no to you, keep going after them. Don’t take no for an answer and really push for what you believe in. A lot of people will try to scare you away and be like, “I don’t really believe in this idea. It’s too early to really say how you’re going to do.” But if you don’t believe in your idea, nobody else is going to. The more you believe in it, the more you can make others believe in it. Just really be passionate about what you’re doing, full send, no hesitation, full send.

(Allyson)

I love full send, like immediately, 100%.

(Nandini)

Yeah.

(Allyson)

You really embody so many leadership qualities, not only in your role at Sensible, but just in general, just talking to you. Truly, you are just so passionate about it. But this past summer, you went to Minnesota on a sea kayaking and backpacking expedition with Outward Bound. What were the leadership skills that you took away from this experience? And how did you apply that to your role in Sensible today?

(Nandini)

Yeah. So, one really big thing was, I think, listening. A lot of times when, obviously, you’re in the woods, and there’s not a lot of stimuli around you, aside from the birds chirping and stuff. But in being in such an isolated area away from your family for so long, I think a lot of being with the group, it wasn’t just me, it was a lot of the people in the group, too, were feeling very down. It’s very hard because I’ve never camped before. I’ve never lived where every day my only goal is just to survive and go to sleep at night. It was very tough the first few weeks. Just being there for others on the team and listening to how they were feeling about the situation empowered me to be more open about how I was feeling. I think I bottled up a lot of my emotions. Really being on this expedition taught me that it was okay to let loose and open up. The other thing was just you never know what the other person is going through. And again, it’s very easy when you’re going through so many emotions at once and in a new environment, it’s very easy to not say anything and pretend like you feel one way when you don’t feel that way at all.

So really listen and observe and just be there for people no matter what. And if there’s a misunderstanding, it’s okay. Be mature about it, and go to them and resolve that conflict. That was a big lesson we learned. One of the best lessons I learned this summer was conflict resolution. Outward Bound is amazing. They had this cool acronym called CFOR: Concern, Feeling, Ownership, and Request. I literally use it for everything. I use it to talk to my professors. I use it to talk to friends. It’s just a way of expressing your feelings. Obviously, when you feel angry or upset about something, your emotions are not intact sometimes, and you get very emotionally charged and are not able to communicate what you feel like communicating. That just provided some structure in my head. But yeah, just people should know. It’s a great abbreviation, please use.

(Allyson)

That experience makes you really reconsider every aspect of your life. You’re like, “Oh, my goodness. I took everything for granted.” It’s fascinating talking to people afterwards, and you’re like, “I’m in different headspace completely!” It’s amazing.

(Nandini)

Oh, yeah.

(Allyson)

But on that same note of summer experiences, so where are you going for Civic Collab? We just found out a couple of days ago. So where are you going for that?

(Nandini)

I’m going to Annapolis, Maryland. So I’m very excited. I’m going to be working with this organization, helping them put together some grant opportunities for some local nonprofits to alleviate poverty. And so, I’m very excited. I have an amazing group that I’m going with, too. So, I’m looking forward to it.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And what do you hope to take away from this upcoming summer?

(Nandini)

I think maybe… I don’t know. I’ve never lived with a lot of people like that in one space while also working with them. I think coming to college, one thing that I really appreciated was alone time because you’re constantly surrounded by people. I just feel like this summer is going to really teach me how to balance that even more: work and personal life. At the same time, be able to meet people who are going through challenges and really see firsthand what’s happening. I feel like I haven’t had a lot of experience in my life witnessing that. I feel like you read about a lot of things in the news, you hear about a lot of things from people or stuff like that. But to really interact one-on-one with stakeholders, I think, would be a crucial experience that I hope to take away from the summer.

(Allyson)

Yeah, nobody talks enough about alone time. I feel like that was one of the biggest things when I got to college. I’m like, when can I be by myself? And it’s just like, never. So, it’s going to be very fascinating to see how that balances out. But my last question has become a staple within all my interviews. What has been your favorite Carolina memory thus far?

(Nandini)

I think for me, going to the stadium at night. I did it for the first-time during Discovery Weekend with a group of scholars, and we were just running around being a little silly. In a stadium so big, you feel so small. And looking up at the sky late at night, you really get to see it. It’s a great view from there. And so, it was just nice to experience some time with friends in a place that isn’t as crowded as maybe the other buildings or quads on the campus. And then I did the same thing the first week of school, so it just seems to be a recurring theme at the start of every semester. So maybe again, very soon, I will do it again.

(Allyson)

Yeah, for sure. It’s very fun going in the stadium when nobody’s there. It’s so nice and quiet. But thank you so much for joining us today. I really appreciate it.

(Nandini)

No, thank you for having me. It’s been amazing. An honor. Thank you.

## Episode Transcription

(Aayas)

*It’s 1:24 a.m., and I am standing outside my tent on the world’s highest glacier. On Everest, you only get one weather window a year to attempt to climb, and I was just told it opened up an hour ago.*

*In front of me on the icefall, I see tiny specks of light moving up. Originating from all corners of the planet, after years of preparation, these specs emanate from the headlamps of the most determined people in the world.*

*Earlier this evening, I met climbers fundraising for disability awareness, for victims of war, advocates bridging racial gaps in mountaineering, climate scientists, documentary teams, and those pushing the known limits of the human body.*

*Base camp is a congregation of the most inspiring people and the most fascinating stories. It’s no wonder I’ve been standing here absolutely mesmerized. I’m in disbelief of where I am, atop a shifting glacier, standing taller than entire continents, next to a lake of clouds shrouding the valley below us, and surrounded by towering peaks glistening next to a rising moon.*

*Just me, my camera, and the captivating stillness of a night in the Himalayas.*

*Two vans to my left. They pull off. Seven lions in front of me. Click, click, click. One hundred photos, 30 minutes, one place. The first lion goes down, the second goes down, the third goes down, and the fourth follows. Edwin says, “A hunt is about to occur.” We take off, the wind brushing our face. The binoculars out. We’re following. Turn left. 1.5 kilometers later, we reach the spot. Boom. The lioness strikes a baby buffalo under the brush. The three lionesses follow. They arrive at the scene. Everyone in the van shocked. The male lion approaches the scene, takes the baby buffalo. The lioness is pushed against our van. We’re all frozen. Click, click, click.*

(Elias)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Elias Guedira, from the class of 2026. Joining us today are Aayas Joshi and Olu Kopano from the class of 2026. The two scholars went on an international gap year through Morehead-Cain. Aayas and Olu share their discoveries and reflections from their time abroad, as well as advice for incoming scholars.*

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining the podcast today.*

(Aayas)

*Thank you.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us on here.*

(Elias)

*For our listeners, Aayas and Olu are both wrapping up their first semester at UNC after taking a gap year through Morehead-Cain’s International Gap Year program. Olu graduated from St. Paul’s School in Baltimore, Maryland, while Aayas graduated from United World College in Changshu, China. Fun fact about Aayas, he is actually the first Morehead-Cain scholar from Nepal. Olu and Aayas, I hope you’ve had a smooth time adapting to life back here in the classroom, but also sufficient time to reflect on your gap year experiences. How does it feel to be back in a traditional learning environment?*

(Olu)

*It feels good. I had a magnificent year, probably the year where I was able to have the most and do the most learning that I’ve done in my life. But near the end of it, I was ready to be back in the school setting. And that school setting looks different now than what it would have pre-gap year. Pre-gap year, I was thinking business, minor in Japanese, and neither of those are in the equation now. Global studies, most likely, and pursuing Spanish, and it’s exactly what I want. I’m taking classes I’m passionate about and have found a direction that I like.*

(Elias)

*Nice.*

(Aayas)

*For me, coming back to conventional education, traditional education, has been interesting. I feel like my gap year prepared me for leaving home and the subtle chaos that is the first semester of college, but also because my gap year helped me decide what path I wanted to take for college, similar to what Olu was saying. And so what I’m studying now feels a little more intentional because I can connect it with what I learned on my gap year.*

(Elias)

*It’s so incredible being able to gain that experience, especially before going into college, really getting to explore the world outside of it before delving into it. So, thank you again for being on the podcast. So, flashback to March 2021. You’re looking at your computer or phone, or mobile device, and you learn that you’ve just received the Morehead-Cain scholarship. What prompts you to say, “Hey, I’m going to press a pause button on my college education and take a gap year for now?”*

(Olu)

*It was the idea that I have loved travel. I was able to travel to Tokyo in high school, had such a memorable experience, and I was missing that feeling. I had opportunities to travel later in high school, but COVID-19 hit, and that ended all possibility of that. So thinking of going into another year of schooling and missing out on the travel that I potentially could have had, just like I’d missed out in the past, was just an opportunity that I felt like I couldn’t miss again, especially when Morehead was funding a significant part of it.*

(Aayas)

*For me, I went to an international school, and so what happened was after they initially sent us back home for COVID, they weren’t able to bring us back. And so, I had gone through one and a half years of online school and was feeling pretty burned out by that point. And I’ve also always believed that the way that the system works right now tends to rush kids into choosing their life’s path of like 17, 18 years old when they haven’t really had a chance to explore what they really want to do. And so, I really liked the idea of taking a pause and exploring my interests in trying to find out what I want to pursue for college.*

*And I think what ended up prompting me to actually take the gap year was, ironically, the Catalyze podcast. I remember, I was listening to the gap year episode before this one, and it was Taylor’s voice—Taylor Shinal, class of ’25—and she was talking about her experience in the Serengeti, watching The Great Migration. And I remember listening to that at home and, like, pacing around my room saying, “I need to do this. This is exciting.”*

(Olu)

*Now that you mentioned that, it was honestly, I can vividly remember the time when I heard the Catalyze podcast on the gap year. And I went, I was sitting on the couch with my dad, and we were listening to it, and we both gave each other the same look and said, “You’re going to do this, you’re going to take this gap year.” And here I am.*

(Elias)

*Yeah, this is a full two years later. It’s such an incredible feeling. I mean, I was also in that same position, having taken a gap year myself, and I remember listening to this podcast and thinking, “Wow, what they did was super cool.” And the fact that we all get to be on the other side of it is such a treat. So a lot of people ended up taking gap years during COVID. Did you have any concerns that this was the wrong path initially? And what would you have to say to anybody that’s taking a gap year right now and might feel a little bit lost?*

(Olu)

*I don’t know if I had any concerns that it was the wrong path, but it is not just one path. It is an experience that is up to you to decide. And that’s scary. That is something that people don’t like. That’s something at one point that I was scared of. I had done all this research, and it led to nothing. And I thought, “What is this gap year going to be? What am I going to do? I have no clue what it’s going to look like.”*

*I was getting frustrated with myself. It was a difficult period, but it was ultimately one of the most rewarding periods of my life because I was, for the first time, had the power to decide what I was going to do with my life for a complete year.*

*So for people in this position now and struggling with what they might potentially do for the second half of the gap year, or if they’re thinking about it in the future, I would say lean into that discomfort because the other side will be better.*

(Elias)

*So if you were to condense your gap year travels into a storybook with chapters, what would you entitle each of those chapters, and what would the setting have been for each of them?*

(Olu)

*That’s a really good question. So I think this kind of goes off my last answer, and the first part was about diving in. So I would label the first chapter, which was Costa Rica, “Diving.” And that was diving into a language that I was unfamiliar with, diving into a culture and area that I was unfamiliar with, and diving into a project, which was construction, and building homes for single mothers, which obviously I had not done construction before. So everything was new. Everything was diving full force into it. And that was probably the first chapter.*

*And the second chapter would be “Solo.” Solo was in Saint Lucia. It was just me there. I was working an internship, and I didn’t know anybody. I had one family member, but other than that, that was it. And my nights were spent by myself. Most of my days were spent by myself. And that period was so important to the growth that I was able to develop later.*

*And the third chapter would be “Homecoming.” Homecoming because I was in Africa in that period. I traveled to Tanzania, Egypt, and Morocco. And even though I’d never been to Africa, my family, me, all of us included, we’ve always felt connected to Africa in some sense or another. And being able to actually step foot on the motherland was really important to me. And really, it felt like I was at home.*

*And I guess the last chapter would just be maybe “Jump Around.” I was in Europe, and I went to seven different countries. I stayed in Spain for six weeks, and then the other six were five days here, five days there. And each chapter was very pivotal in the gap year.*

(Aayas)

*My chapters would be slightly different. I think the first chapter I would call, “Hey, why don’t we go to Everest?” Fun little hike. So I had lived in Nepal for 18, 19 years, and I had never seen Mount Everest. So I told a group of friends, “Why don’t we go hiking and go see it?” And so that was the first chapter.*

*The second chapter I would call, “Oops, I accidentally hitchhiked the entire South Asian coast” because that was not the intention when I left home. I left on a fairly spontaneous international flight to New Delhi, and I happened to travel for almost two months, over 8,000 miles, 26 cities, around the entire South Asian coastline. So that was really fun.*

*Chapter three would probably be “Returned to Everest for a cause.” So that’s when I started to work on climate change projects in the region.*

*And the fourth project would be, I’d probably call it “The heritage project.” So for context, in 2015, Nepal faced a mega earthquake that flattened half of my city. And so a big debate that was sparked after that was, how do we preserve and document heritage so that we don’t lose it again? And I worked with a professor at UNC actually, a religious studies professor at UNC, on documenting tangible and intangible heritage 3D models, things like that. So that was a really cool project that I worked on, but those would be my four chapters.*

(Elias)

*So when you say documenting tangible and intangible artifacts, what exactly do you mean by that?*

(Aayas)

*It was really cool, actually. We had a team of people, and we would fly LiDAR drones around heritage sites to then 3D model them later. And the goal was to be able to create a virtual space where you can access this heritage and also have annotated stories and pictures and ways to explore the area without actually being there, so that if another earthquake does come and destroys the heritage, there’s still a replica or a version of it that we can still visit later.*

(Elias)

*Aayas, for viewers that are unfamiliar with your line of work, you spend a lot of time documenting monuments, documenting stories through photography, storytelling, and blogging. In fact, you’re working on a project with the goal of helping integrate Himalayan communities into scientific research and documenting the effects of global warming on these communities to spread awareness. Can you talk a little bit more about how you got involved with this project during your gap year?*

(Aayas)

*The first time I went to Everest Base Camp, I was amazed by how beautiful it is and all of that. But I was also very shocked by how many concerning things I saw that I had not heard about or I don’t think people generally knew about.*

*I remember this specific moment when I was walking on a glacier, the world’s highest glacier; it’s called the Khumbu Glacier. It was at 5,500 meters in elevation, that’s approximately 18 \[thousand\] feet, I believe. And we were walking on a solid glacier, and my foot went into the glacier, so it went into a meltwater pond. And my guide then was shocked and surprised, and he kept saying, “That’s not supposed to happen. This is not supposed to be melting. These puddles weren’t here last week.” And that got me really concerned. That experience is something I couldn’t forget even after I went back.*

*And so I started doing some research, and I started seeing these really concerning headlines, things along the lines of, the region is warming three times faster than the global average, or Everest alone has lost more than 2,000 years’ worth of ice and snow in the last 30 years, and how climate change in the region is expected to impact 1.5 billion people in South Asia. That’s one in every four humans. And so, after hearing all of that and realizing that not a lot of people knew about it, I thought that I wanted to do something. But at the time, I didn’t really know what I could do other than spread the word. So I tabled it for some time, and then I went on my India trip, and this thought of “I should do something” kept bothering me. I couldn’t let it go.*

*Coincidentally, after my India trip, I had other international plans that, because of visa issues, passport issues, or generally COVID restrictions, I had to cancel. And so I took that as a sign that I should go back to Everest. And I told myself, I’m going back. This time I’m going to take my filming gear with me, and I’m going to try to document what I saw and share it with others because maybe if people saw what I saw, maybe if people heard the stories that I heard, they would want to know more about the issue. They would care about it. And so that was the goal.*

*And before I went, I went on the Morehead-Cain Network, and I found Noam Argov. She’s the class of 2015. She’s a documentary filmmaker. So I sent her an email saying, “Hey, I really want to work on this. Do you know it? Do you have any advice, any wisdom for me?” (Hey, Noam, if you’re listening to this, very grateful to you.) But she linked me with this nonprofit called Himalayan Climate and Science Institute, and with them, I was able to work on projects integrating local communities with scientific research.*

*So the project that they were working on aimed to train local community members there to work on weather stations so that we don’t have to, like, fly out technicians and scientists from the other side of the world, which would speed up the data collection process quite a lot.*

(Elias)

*It’s so wonderful that you were able to capture the effects, the disproportional effects that climate change really has on people, especially in communities where people may feel unheard or not linked to media or scientific research. So I’d like to applaud you for all the great work that you’re doing there.*

*Olu, you entitled the portion of your gap year that you spent in Saint Lucia “Solo.” From my understanding, you spent a significant amount of time alone when you were working in Saint Lucia. You frequently mention that you had realizations while you were staying in the country, while you were spending nights and days by yourself. Can you share with listeners what you found to be the value of being alone and any discoveries you had about yourself or the environment?*

(Olu)

*First, being alone, I think the biggest discovery was surrounding learning, and I think I hinted at it earlier where I said the gap year was the year that I felt like I’d done the most learning ever in my life. And I really think that started in Saint Lucia. I honestly wasn’t the most excited as I was when I was going to Tanzania and Spain when it came to Saint Lucia, because I was alone, and I had not been alone for a significant period of time. Even when I was in Costa Rica, I joined a program, I was with a ton of people my age. But now I had an internship with middle-aged individuals, and then I was back in, just me, and that was scary.*

*So I wasn’t really the most excited for it. But again, I leaned into it, and it paid off. I had time to think about, just self-reflect. I had time to engage in different podcasts. I had time to start my Spanish learning and picking up Quizlet. I had time to read. And just by being alone, I learned more about myself. I found interests that I didn’t know I had.*

*And one more thing. Going off of the second part that you had about learning about the environment around me, I think this actually wasn’t done alone, but having that kind of experience where I was more tuned in to the place that I was working and place I was living. I definitely think I had some of those experiences.*

*So one, really quickly, would be working in concierge at a five-star resort. I was surrounded by other employees from Saint Lucia, and Saint Lucia, for those who don’t know, was colonized by the French and by the British, and it was a seven-time colonized by the French and eight-time by the U.K. And just looking at the effects that it had on how people were treated was very, very present. So a lot of folks from the U.K. would go to Saint Lucia for holiday, and I could see instantly the dynamic where the treatment was still from some sort of colonial approach, where, whether it was a demeaning tone or a place of “I’m better than you,” and it was really interesting to just be on the outside of that.*

*And yes, I looked like the Saint Lucians, but when I was approached, and when I was talking with guests, I could instantly see the difference because I didn’t have that St. Lucian background, and maybe having that time reflecting, being in that place where I was learning and creating and exploring my identity as well, I was able to see that in a different lens.*

*It’s so interesting being able to dive into that environment, especially from an American perspective. You kind of get to see the effects that colonialism and systemic injustices have on other countries and how your experience differs vastly from other people’s just because of your nationality.*

*Now, Olu, you mentioned doing a lot of things that you seem to appreciate more while you were alone. For me, I love to channel my thoughts through journaling and blogging. I also spent a considerable amount of time on Duolingo improving my languages. How did you go about expressing yourself, whether that was through journaling or storytelling among friends and family?*

(Olu)

*Journaling was definitely number one. I looked back at it the other day, actually, at my gap year journal, and I had over 60,000 words, I had around 100 pages of journaling, and whether it was only a few sentences a day or two pages a day, and that was more for me. That was more of the self-reflection. That was more of seeing the growth that I had from the beginning of the gap year to the end.*

*But I also had other forms, whether it was my Instagram and keeping people engaged with photos and stories, or whether it was just through photography. For example, in Tanzania, when we were there, actually, during the Serengeti trip, I was able to take over 1.200—1,300 photos and videos, and I still have them as my screensavers today. And just, that being a reminder of what is out there in the world and seeing incredible sites, Ngorongoro Crater, lions hunts, and elephants. And knowing that that can happen, and I lived that, and I look forward to doing something like that. And again, and obviously, that’s all thanks to Morehead, the Morehead-Cain funding that I was able to receive from them.*

(Elias)

*Wonderful. And you, Aayas?*

(Aayas)

*For me, I must say, Elias, it was actually you that inspired me to start documenting more. I remember in the beginning of the year when you and Spence took that road trip across North America, and you had a blog, and you were posting pictures. I remember looking at it and going, “That is so cool. I want to start doing more of that, too, like documenting more of my journeys.”*

*And so I’ve always loved photography. And so when I went trekking, when I went on my different gap year trips, I started taking pictures and posting little story blogs and story sessions on Instagram, and that’s where most of my documenting happened. Personally, I also journaled quite a bit. I had an online journal that has thousands and thousands of words. It’s always nice to look back at some of them and see a year ago I was here doing this.*

(Elias)

*I feel so honored that I inspired you to take a blogging and photography, and I also have to respect you for what you have done with it and how you have gone about documenting your gap year. I have always admired that.*

(Aayas)

Thank you, Elias.

(Elias)

*Okay, this is a tough question. What is your favorite memory from your gap year?*

(Olu)

*I often tell people, I kind of break it up into experiences, and I might cheat a little bit with this question.*

*My favorite experience was the, I think it was seven of us in Tanzania and the Serengeti trip that we had, a seven day experience where we’re living out in tents and we’re hearing hyenas right behind us while we’re trying to sleep, and we’re waking up to elephants tearing down trees. That would probably be my favorite experience.*

*And my favorite trip would be you and me, actually, in Morocco, eight days where were in Rabat, we’re in Marrakesh, and we take a three-day, two-night trip to the Sahara, and we’re riding camels into the sunset and going to sleep in the Sahara and waking up and sand boarding through the dunes. And I would probably say those two experiences were the most memorable and my favorite memories, for sure.*

(Aayas)

*One of my favorite experiences that was actually recurring throughout my gap year was seeing the Milky Way.*

*So I love stargazing, personally, and so to be able to see the Milky Way in the sky from different places: one, from Everest Base Camp when I was surrounded by the glistening peaks, the world’s highest mountains towering over me. Seeing the Milky Way on the night that I bivvied in the Thar Desert—it’s in northwest India. The day that we found an oasis and slept next to it.*

*Seeing the Milky Way from the backwaters of Kerala in a tropical rainforest, and then seeing the Milky Way next to bioluminescent waves on the southernmost tip of South India. That would probably be my favorite experience for my gap year, seeing the same thing across these different places.*

(Elias)

*I know there’s so many things to choose from, and personally, I cannot pick one single favorite memory from the gap year. I think they’re all special in their own ways. My final question for you, if you could give one piece of advice to your pre-gap year self, what would that piece of advice be?*

(Olu)

*Don’t make a plan. That might not be the advice that I should be giving right now, but I think the most important experiences that I had in my gap year weren’t planned. They were made by mistake. They happened because my plan fell through, and I had to come up with something different.*

*I think having that flexibility to find an interest and be in a country, and then that spark an idea of what to do next, where to go next, that would be what I say to do. Don’t have a plan. Don’t create a whole year of what you think you’re going to do because you won’t do it. Lean into the unknown and stick with it.*

(Aayas)

*I really agree with that, Olu. My advice to myself would be very similar. The best place for you is where you naturally gravitate to and not necessarily the path you carve out for yourself.*

*I know you guys know this, Olu and Elias, but for the listeners, prior to going on my gap year trips, I thought Morehead-Cain was really strict with what they wanted me to do and how I could use their stipend. So I produced an 83-page PDF of my gap year plan. I planned every single day. It had maps, it had color-coded calendars, and I ended up doing almost none of that.*

*I’m very glad that it worked out that way, because I would not trade the experiences I had on my gap year for anything.*

(Elias)

*Aayas and Olu, thank you so much for joining Catalyze today.*

(Olu)

*Thank you for having us. It was a pleasure.*

(Elias)

*Thank you for joining Catalyze. I’m Elias Guedira from the class of 2026, and that was Olu Kapano and Aayas Joshi from the class of 2026. You can let us know what you thought of the episode by emailing us at communications@moreheadcain.org or by following us on Twitter or Instagram at @moreheadcain.*

(Abbey Beebe ’27)

*Hello, everyone. This is Abbey Beebe.*

*I am a current gap year scholar, and right now, I’m on an island off the coast of Honduras called Utila, and it’s about 9:52 p.m., and I just jumped into the Caribbean Sea.*

*And I want you to picture every time you move a limb, so you kick or you move your arm, the ocean lights up like a galaxy full of stars. And this is because of the bioluminescence.*

*And it’s truly a magical experience. And it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. And I’m just lucky to be here.*

(Elias)

*It’s mid-October. The sun shines, golden. Transparent, deep blue sky colliding with gleaming sands in the horizon. I look at the point of earth stretching highest to the sun, Erg Chebbi, the tallest dune in Morocco, and among those in the Sahara Desert. An unforeseen impulse rises in me, screaming in me, telling me to climb.*

*I call out to my friend from Arabic class. She wears an orange and black caftan and a scarf, protecting her vision from the sun’s piercing rays. She looks on from a nearby ridge, observing like a tiger. I let her know it could take a while before I come down.*

*I dig my foot into the mountain before me and begin. Grains of sand sift beneath my toes while an hourglass sifts above my head. The sun above me encroaches the earth. As I wear a blue jillaba, I fight its fabric clawing at my feet, holding my movement as I climb. Suddenly, the sand loses grip of the mountain it’s clinging to. The sound of friction as the particles slide. I lose my footing. Now, futilely, I’m stretching my feet and arms into the only surface I can see in front of me.*

*I breathe. Regain control. The sun pulls closer. As I ascend, I hear voices in another language. Blurs of movement behind heat waves. Two tourists enjoying their first days in Morocco. We trade names and stories. We appreciate two vastly different views.*

*I look back to my friend. Behind her neck, tents and base camp. And then, the Hamada. A barren expanse of rock desert. Shale floating on eerily still sand like melting ice on the surface of a lake. Shards of rock cracking and drifting apart. Black mountains fold upward in the distance, indicating the last frontier before Algeria.*

*I turn around towards the sun setting in front of me, an ocean of sand. Waves arcing in every direction, formations that must have been caused by some sort of tempest. Below, at the horizon, riders on camelbacks piercing their way through the rolling dunes like ships in a storm. I stay here for a moment, admiring the stillness from above. Breeze blows from the west. The sun meets earth and back into the quiet storm. I descend.*

(Chandler Beals ’27)

*Hello, everyone.*

*My name is Chandler Beals, and I am a current gap year scholar. And right now, I’m sitting at the Las Vegas airport. I have a layover here on my way home from Baja California Sur, Mexico, where I did the Baja Sea Kayaking course through the National Outdoor Leadership School, NOLS.*

*Yes, I just had a really mediocre panini, and I’m sitting here with my iced coffee, just kind of people watching and reflecting on my trip. I feel very content, very thankful, and also a little sad. It’s hard to live with people for an entire month and really get to know them well, and then, just as quickly as you came, have to leave them behind.*

*With traveling a lot, I feel like my heart’s in a lot of different places, but at the same time, it’s a really good feeling. And, yeah, I leave for Sweden in a week, and I’m really happy to be here.*

## Episode transcription

(Charles)

Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Charles McCain from the class of ’27. We have with us today Patton McDowell from the class of ’89. The alumnus is the founder and president of PMA Nonprofit Leadership. The firm provides philanthropic and organizational consulting services. Patton is also the host of the podcast, Your Path to Nonprofit Leadership, a Career Development Series focused on Philanthropy.

Patton, thank you for joining us.

(Patton)

Charles, great to be here. Thanks for having me.

(Charles)

I know you’re based in Charlotte, so what brings you to Chapel Hill today?

(Patton)

A lot of my work now is close to my hometown. I grew up in Elizabeth City, in the northeast corner of the state. Interestingly, while based in Charlotte, some of the nonprofit organizations I’m working with are in Eastern North Carolina. So, this was a perfect stop on my journey back to Charlotte.

(Charles)

Okay, great. Well, it’s amazing to have you in town. I’m looking forward to delving deeper into your expertise and learning more about your passion for nonprofit leadership in the charitable sector. So, to begin, what inspired you to focus your career on nonprofit leadership and development?

(Patton)

I’ve got to give the Morehead-Cain Foundation credit. It was one of my summer internships. In fact, I was working for Special Olympics International. At that point, I was like, this will be fun to be in Washington, D.C. for a summer. But I admittedly didn’t have career aspirations at that point. But it was a literally life-changing and certainly career-changing opportunity. I worked in the offices of the global headquarters. Eunice Kennedy-Shriver, the founder of Special Olympics and sister of President Kennedy, was still working there in 1989. This was part of my junior-senior year. That internship exposed me to opportunities in nonprofit leadership. They ended up hiring me after I finished the internship, and I spent almost ten years working for that organization.

(Charles)

Wow, okay. How do you feel like you made that transition to working for somebody else to then wanting to found PMA Nonprofit Leadership?

(Patton)

Yeah, that’s a good question. I spent another ten years after Special Olympics working in higher education. I was the Chief Fundraiser at UNC Wilmington and then Queens University in Charlotte. I had gotten a taste of Special Olympics and higher education, both public and private, and always had a sense of wanting to help nonprofit organizations as a consultant. I think my work in Special Olympics helped prepare me for that. Special Olympics North Carolina, for example, has local programs in nearly eighty-five of the 100 counties in North Carolina. So, a lot of my work was going into these communities and helping them do whatever they needed. And it got me thinking about, this is consulting. The work I was doing through Special Olympics felt like it was something that I would like to do full-time. So about fifteen years ago, I started PMA Nonprofit Leadership to continue that work, helping nonprofits through leadership development, fundraising, and strategic planning.

(Charles)

Okay. And so obviously, as someone who started a nonprofit yourself, I’m curious how nonprofit leaders can excel in planning, funding, and building a dynamic organization to stand out in such a competitive landscape.

(Patton)

It’s a great question. And in fact, that’s exactly often where organizations will come to me. Typically, fundraising is the headline for most nonprofits. They need funding to do their mission. And so, I’ll get the outreach, the call, the email, something along those lines. How can we raise more funds to do what we want to do? But a lot of the work I end up doing breaks down into different areas because they need—it’s hard to be an effective fundraising organization if you’re not clear on your strategic vision. Where are you going? I think funders want to know indeed, what is your vision for the charitable cause that you’re supporting? So, I get involved that way in helping them define their vision. What is that one-, three-, and five-year goal that they’re trying to achieve? And then that breaks down into different activities. Sometimes it’s staff development, sometimes it’s board development. Again, nonprofits rely on volunteer boards of directors, so I do a lot of board trainings and workshops for them, and helping them generally strengthen their activities so that, one, they can better educate the community about their work and then help them fund it.

(Charles)

Okay. Just on that note of trying to find ways to maximize the success of these nonprofits, I’m curious: what are some of the key challenges that these nonprofits are facing today?

(Patton)

That’s another good question. Sometimes it’s overwhelm. Often, they are doing a lot with a little… I don’t want to generalize the nonprofit sector, but often, they are less resourced than their for-profit friends, and so they’re trying to do many things, and that can lead to the risk of burnout. So, my work is trying to sharpen the activities of their staff so that they’re focused on the right things and not wearing themselves out. But I think that’s a challenge. The challenge, because of that burnout maybe, turnover in the sector is a real problem. There are a lot of great causes, but when the talent leaves a nonprofit, it makes it difficult, of course, for them to sustain the work they’re doing.

So, I focus on leadership development at three different levels. One is the emerging leader, the newer nonprofit professional, helping them get settled and successful, and then helping nonprofit leaders as they move through their mid-career and then ultimately into executive leadership. But at every level, I think the challenge to your question is the risk of burnout. And so, if they burn out, we lose them. That hurts their organization.

(Charles)

Yeah, totally understandable. And with that, so how do you feel, or what are the specific initiatives you feel PMA takes to tackle these obstacles and challenges they’re facing?

(Patton)

Often, it’s strategic networking because I think a lot of nonprofit leaders feel that it’s a lonely world for them. They feel isolated, in addition to being overwhelmed sometimes by the work that they’re doing. And so, a lot of our work is helping connect them to like-minded individuals, helping them find peer support. I have a Mastermind Leadership Program, which has allowed me to bring together nonprofit leaders from all over the country. And so, it’s a virtual gathering, but it’s amazing when you put good people, talented, motivated people into a virtual setting, good things happen, and they can share their challenges. They’re able to lean on each for resources and ideas. That, I think, is in a small part helping sustain them, maybe keeping them from jumping out of an organization where they just feel overwhelmed. Also, just providing them resources. Like you mentioned earlier, I have enjoyed a podcast that allows me to talk to nonprofit leaders all over the world. And so, in turn, I hope that becomes a resource for those that are listening to learn from the experience of nonprofit leaders and experts. And then I’m involved in several training programs, fundraising-related, board development-related. But those are the three categories of work we do: resource material, individual training, and then organizational consulting.

(Charles)

Interesting. And speaking of working with different leaders around the world, I’m just curious, how do you feel like different places around the world have different strategies towards nonprofits? And where do you feel like you’ve seen been most effective and some things that haven’t worked as well?

(Patton)

The good news is I think there are more similarities than differences. Nonprofit leaders that I’ve spoken with in any sector, in any community, anywhere in the world, they have a passion for doing good, and they’re just trying to do it in an effective and efficient manner. There are differences within the philanthropic support networks by country. Charitable giving as a philosophy and as a legal process is different. So that’s where I’ve talked to folks from different continents, literally, and they’re struggling with just one, availability of philanthropy, and then the different rules and regulations behind it. But because of the virtual connection around the world, where I’ve seen even more successes, no matter where they are, they can appeal to funding anywhere else in the world. And so, they’re not just local. In fact, that’s where the most successful nonprofits around the world have—they’ve maximized their digital presence. And if you set up your website effectively and make that call to action, you can generate funding, and that’s where I’ve seen success.

(Charles)

Thank you so much. And on the note of worldwide communication, I’d like to explore more about how you share these insights with a broader audience. So, I know your organization started in 2009, but you began your podcast, Your Path to Nonprofit Leadership in 2019. Could you tell us more about the inspiration behind starting that podcast?

(Patton)

All right. I got to give credit, Charles, to my daughter, Lauren, who graduated from college in 2019. She, of course, grew up in the work that I did and knew of our firm and said, “You know what? Maybe a podcast would be a media format that we could leverage.” She knew I like to talk a lot, so maybe that was a call out to if I’m enjoying the conversations that I’m having anyway, why not put that into a podcast format? We started literally, like, all right, let’s just do five episodes and just try to see if we can survive. But once we started the streak. It’s funny how once you get a weekly cadence, which we have now, you don’t want to break it. We started on National Philanthropy Day back in 2019 and have maintained a Thursday release ever since. I must confess, there has been some late Wednesday night work to get it out Thursday morning. But fortunately, we have gotten enthusiasm from our audience and the people we’ve been able to speak to. Hopefully, I’m intentional or at least trying to be, what takeaways can each conversation lead to for someone who’s a current nonprofit leader or they want to be? And so, I try to generate conversations around those themes. As in, what did you learn along the way as you moved into nonprofit leadership, and what will that help or how will that help those that are listening?

(Charles)

And I’m curious, do you have a favorite episode in all the episodes you have?

(Patton)

I guess some of the milestone episodes, naturally, you feel proud about. The 100th episode, I had a friend of mine that worked, his name is Chris Delisio. He works at Ohio State University. So, he co-hosted the 100th. But it allowed us to talk about some of the, in essence, the greatest hits of the first 100 episodes. It was something I was certainly proud of because we could say, “You know what? We’ve had some great conversations about those key things you and I have already talked about: fundraising advice, strategic planning advice, building your board, all the things and some of the struggles that episode lifted up.” But just recently, we had our 250th episode, and so that similarly allowed us to reflect on some of the conversations we’ve had. But it’d be hard to pick beyond that. It’s like choosing your favorite kid. You love your children, all of them. I’ve been very fortunate to have great guests throughout.

(Charles)

Well, congratulations on the 250 episodes. I imagine, looking back five years, that’s just such an accomplishment to have.

I’m curious how you go about selecting your guests, but also the theme or topic for the podcast.

(Patton)

Yeah, it’s a great question. Fortunately, early on, I started with just my own network, work in higher education, work at Special Olympics, work in the various nonprofit communities. Since then, we’ve gotten quite a few, I guess, requests to be guests. It’s interesting. There’s a whole market now, I think, for podcast guesting. I get emails almost daily from folks saying, “Hey, we think so and so would be a great guest,” and some indeed are. But now it’s been, as much as anything, a referral business. In other words, when I talk to a nonprofit leader from Australia, I will ask her, “Who else do you think would lend their voice to nonprofit leadership there?” We have been able to generate a list of folks that, hopefully, we will get on the podcast. But right now, we’re able to stay ahead six to eight weeks because of guests that often come as referrals from others, and then also just folks that I’ve worked with. We’ve worked with a couple of hundred organizations as a firm, and so it gives me a wonderful resource list to go to and talk to leaders that have inspired me and see if they’ll join me on the podcast.

(Charles)

That’s amazing. Speaking of your podcast, in a recent episode with Lance Kawaguchi, you discussed the issue of nonprofits focusing on perceived community needs rather than the actual needs of a community. When you encounter this situation in a struggling nonprofit, how do you guide them in adjusting their mission without jeopardizing the founder’s vision or drastically altering their organizational structure?

(Patton)

Yeah, that is a challenge. Lance nailed it in terms of some of the things he has dealt with because he inherited an organization serving the cancer community but was struggling. I think a lot of it starts with clear and effective communication. I think a lot of organizations, because they are immersed in it, assume that their communities understand what they do. I learned it even in Special Olympics, because a lot of people have maybe a positive feeling about your organization, but they don’t fully appreciate all that you do. For Special Olympics, it was like, “Oh, I guess that’s just a once-a-year track meet,” and they didn’t realize the depth and breadth of the programming. We’re doing thirty Olympic-style sports. We’re year-round. We’re helping all ages. Lance was dealing with some of the same things where people didn’t appreciate what he was doing, but he reframed it. He, I think, “sharpened his vision” is the phrase I use, and Mrs. Shriver used it thirty-some years ago, identifying how can we effectively educate those that we work with of the need and then inspire them with we’re going to do something about it. I think a lot of times I look at nonprofit organizations, I see lots of messaging, but often, it becomes cluttered. In other words, too many good messages, even if they’re all good, can become noise. Having a real focus on clarity is where I think it starts. Then that leads to things like raising more money, but you must start with the messaging, and Lance is a great example of that.

(Charles)

Thank you. How do you go about finding the true needs of the community?

(Patton)

Conversations, and often, this is a chance for your board of directors to use their ambassador role for you. I run into a lot of that as a challenge where the nonprofit leader will tell me, “Yeah, my board, they’re either disengaged or they’re micromanaging me, but they’re not being effective.” And so, turning your board members into more effective ambassadors, a lot of the workshops I do are on exactly that point. And so, their ability to get into the community and have conversations does help determine what the needs are, and then also helps you get your message in front of the key leaders in your community. So, board engagement, I think, is a critical element that can help you with conversations and messaging in both directions.

(Charles)

Thank you. Could you share maybe a case study or success story that exemplifies the impact PMA can have on an organization’s success, highlighting the importance of effective leadership and fundraising in the nonprofit sector?

(Patton)

Yeah. In fact, one that I visited with this week is in Kinston, North Carolina. The gentleman named Chris Jenkins started an organization called Hope Restorations. It’s fantastic. And it has addressed multiple issues in that community, to your earlier question. The issues were one, folks that are coming out of incarceration or drug rehabilitation, dealing with challenges, having a difficult time getting back into the workforce. Chris started Hope Restorations, and I was able to work with him early on about, all right, how do we provide training, workforce development for these individuals who are struggling to get back on their feet? He taught them construction skills. He took the construction skills and allowed these, mostly men at first. Now, there are men and women now in the program. What they do is they rehabilitate homes that have fallen into disrepair in Lenoir County or Kinston. In other words, these homes have become an eyesore in their neighborhoods. Chris said, “You know what? Maybe we can achieve multiple goals. I can train these men and help them get into paying jobs. We can also improve neighborhoods.” Then the third, the triple crown of this organization, is he’s providing affordable rental properties, which is a huge challenge in many communities. For folks who are just trying to get by, they can’t find good places, certainly affordable places, to live. He’s training individuals, he’s improving neighborhoods, and now he’s providing affordable rental properties. It’s been a fantastic example, and Chris deserves all the credit, but he’s rallied his community and his board, and he’s now getting funding and attention from throughout the region because other counties nearby his are seeing, that triple crown of success is something we want as well.

(Charles)

That’s amazing. To shift gears a bit, I noticed that in 2019, you wrote a book with the same title as your podcast, Your Path to Nonprofit Leadership. Why did you decide to write this book, and what unique insights did you hope to share that differ from what you share in your podcast?

(Patton)

That’s a great question, Charles. It’s one of those things I think a lot of people—we all have a book in our head. I think you all can agree, and probably your listeners can as well. I had something in my head for years. The book allowed me to put what I had been teaching and coaching for twenty-some years into print. It occurred to me as I was preparing to put the book together, there were seven essential steps, I thought, along the path to nonprofit leadership. And so that became the framework for the book. And some of these things are certainly familiar in terms of career development in any sector. But I thought it was a unique combination of these seven steps to allow nonprofit leaders or aspiring nonprofit leaders to go through a program, if you will, to get better. And I built the Mastermind Program that I described to you earlier using those same steps, if you will, they become modules for that training program. And it still allows for an individual to design something unique to them. So, it’s not so formulaic that there’s one size fits all. But the book allowed me to put together lessons I’ve learned through my leadership journey, and maybe more importantly, what I’ve learned working with people, and then hopefully giving them a formula, I talk about what can you do in the next twelve months? So, it’s not just a far off, someday I’m going to be ready to be a nonprofit leader. I’m like, all right, let’s talk about what you can do now to sharpen your vision personally, to build your strategic network, to curate the knowledge you need to advance. And hopefully, it is helpful, but it was fun to put it together. It was fun to get it over with, too, though, right? It’s nice to be done, but that was the basis of the book.

(Charles)

And how did you go about narrowing to just seven steps with it being such probably a complicated process?

(Patton)

I went back and forth. I started with five early in my consulting career and then added and subtracted content. So, over the last fifteen years of my consulting practice, it just seemed to land comfortably with seven. That’s what I stuck with. But I had been using that formula in a lot of the coaching and teaching I did and thought, it makes sense. And there was a rhythm to that. And that’s how I ended up with seven.

(Charles)

Thank you. And to shift gears one last time, I’m curious. I know you talked earlier about the internship you were able to have, but how do you feel like Morehead-Cain, whether it was the community, the values, shaped your path towards nonprofit leadership?

(Patton)

Yeah, I can’t begin to overstate that because like I said, if it weren’t for the Morehead-Cain opportunity and particularly the internship and the summer experiences, I don’t know what I would be doing. I was convinced at that part in my life I wanted to be a high school basketball coach, believe it or not. I was obsessed. Maybe it was my failed attempts as an athlete to then go into coaching. And so literally that summer, I thought, all right, well, I was an education major here at Carolina, and so I literally thought I’d be an English teacher, basketball coach. And so, the opportunity through the internship to learn about a career opportunity like Special Olympics changed my life and showed me that I think I had viewed mistakenly the nonprofit sector as a feel-good volunteer role. Yeah, you can be an intern, but it’s not really a career option, but it totally changed my thinking. It’s like, wow, this is a complex global organization that has professional opportunities. That became the career-defining path for me, and that’s why I’ll forever be grateful for Morehead-Cain for that.

(Charles)

Thank you. What advice do you have for current scholars who are interested in making a difference in the nonprofit sector or creating their own nonprofit organization themselves?

(Patton)

Volunteer with organizations for which you have passion. I emphasize that because there are a lot of well-intentioned scholars and others that I’ve spoken with who want to jump to start a nonprofit. I don’t want to diminish that enthusiasm, but my suggestion-advice would learn about others in the space that you’re considering. If you’re starting a healthcare nonprofit, well, maybe you should volunteer with some healthcare nonprofits in your community. Understand, volunteer. You could even serve on their board, help fundraise for them, help with an event. But my caution is jumping too quickly into starting your own and then perhaps competing with other good causes. Now, you may, through your research and experience, find, you know what, nobody is doing what I think needs to be done. Then good for you. Let’s start a nonprofit. I’ve worked with organizations with that mentality. But my advice would be, do your homework, research organizations like that one you’re pondering, because then that will help improve, I guess, your own plan when you do indeed start one yourself.

(Charles)

And speaking of that competitive landscape, have you ever seen nonprofit organizations fighting for the same cause? Have you ever encouraged them to merge, and what does that look like?

(Patton)

It’s a great question. In fact, a lot of funders are asking that question. Those who have the means to invest in nonprofits must answer the question. We’ve got twenty good causes on our desk asking us for money, and four of them are doing the exact same thing in our community. You risk funders saying, “You know what? I like what you’re saying, Charles, but there are three other organizations also doing that. Have you considered whether you might collaborate with them?” Funders like collaboration. Often, they will invest in collaboration. So, my work, counseling or coaching an organization is, yes, always look for collaborative opportunities because it will, I think, help your funding opportunities. Otherwise, there’s not enough to go around, and you risk not fully maximizing your good cause because you’re spread too thin.

(Charles)

And is the collaboration something that you see nonprofit leaders willing to do, or is it something they struggle to do?

(Patton)

It’s a great question. It makes sense on paper in many cases, but often when I broach that conversation, they’re like, “Yeah, I’d be willing to merge with that other organization across town, but if we do it my way.” Then you go talk to the other organization across town, they’re like, “Well, we would merge with them, but we do it better than they do.” You end up with the inevitable just personality conflicts. That has been my experience. Everyone agrees on paper we should collaborate, but it’s hard, especially when you have founders who put their heart and soul into starting their own nonprofit. Hard for them to give it up and merge with somebody else.

(Charles)

Yeah, I believe it. One of my final questions is, in my experience with Morehead-Cain Scholars, I’ve noticed a common theme of pursuing a nonlinear path, much like your journey from higher education to working with Special Olympic groups and now doing nonprofit consulting. And so, how do you believe these varied roles and decisions have shaped your career? And what advice do you have for others navigating a nonlinear path in seeking direction?

(Patton)

Well, I’m a big fan of the nonlinear path, as you might guess, because each of my experiences has allowed me to experience a diversity of thought and perspective and opportunity and strengthened, I think, ultimately, my own consulting practice. Now that I have children in a similar early graduate stage, I’m encouraging them to do the same thing. There’s a pressure sometimes, I think, on the emerging leader generation. I got to have it all figured out. My career at twenty-four is necessarily going to be the one that I’m going to take all the way to the finish line, and I don’t think that’s the case. My advice is to experience different sectors, different opportunities, professions. I hope, regardless of the professional track any of the Morehead-Cain Scholars take, I hope they’ll be involved in their nonprofit community. The nonprofit community needs talent that Morehead-Cain Scholars can bring. Maybe it’s as a volunteer or as a board member. But my advice would be it’s also an important way to get to know your community through the lens of nonprofit organizations.

(Charles)

That’s great advice. Thank you. Just to wrap up, I’d love to hear about your favorite memory from your time as a Morehead-Cain Scholar at Chapel Hill.

(Patton)

I must go back to the summer experiences. Now, again, I know I should speak to the academic experience here in Chapel Hill, which I guess maybe some classes I was more engaged than others, I will be the first to admit. But again, the summer experiences, the memories that I still have, the friends I still talk to. I was on the West Coast in Palo Alto for what was then the law enforcement opportunity, social sector. That was a wonderful summer. Of course, I’ve talked about the Special Olympics experience in D.C. I also had an experience with Hallmark Cards in St. Louis, which, again, as I reflect on that, I was like, Hallmark Cards. But again, it was fascinating. You can learn so much from any of these experiences. For me, those experiences. Then one, my singular athletic, I guess, claim to fame: I made the JV basketball team when Roy Williams was here the first time. That was the opportunity to work with Coach Williams. He left the next year for Kansas in his Kansas tenure before coming back, of course, to Chapel Hill. But that experience, while he ran the dickens out of me, that’s a phrase Coach Williams often used. He’s such a nice guy, but people don’t realize that he is an intense coach. I experienced it firsthand. Maybe that told me that basketball was not going to be my path forward, but a great memory, nonetheless.

(Charles)

I can’t think of something better than that to play for Coach Williams. That’s amazing. But that’s all for today. So, thank you so much for joining us. It’s been a pleasure to hear about your life and your career. I’m inspired by the work you’ve done and just want to say congratulations for all you’ve done. And thank you for being here today.

(Patton)

Charles, it’s a pleasure. Thank you for being part of this.

## Episode transcription

(Allyson)

Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Allison Horst from the class of ’27. We have with us today, Sachi Akmal from the class of ’28. Currently on Morehead-Cain’s International Gap Year program, Sachi has so far visited ten countries over the span of nine months. From climbing Mount Kilimanjaro to exploring Italian monasteries, Sachi has explored so many regions of the world and has immersed herself in the local culture of each place she has visited. Her gap year will conclude this fall as she enters her first year at Carolina as a public policy major.

Thank you, Sachi, for joining us today. Where were you before you came back home to North Carolina? And why did you come back home this weekend?

(Sachi)

Well, first, thank you for having me, Allyson. I just spent six weeks in Morocco and had a quick layover in London before I came back to North Carolina to regroup before I take for my next and final international segment of my gap year, which will be in Japan. So, I just wanted to stop by and say hi to some of my friends here at UNC, including you. Yeah, that’s why I’m here.

(Allyson)

It’s so exciting seeing you. I love when you get to come back and just hearing all your stories. And just joining us today in itself is just so awesome.

(Sachi)

I know, yeah.

(Allyson)

But what ultimately motivated you to participate in the Morehead-Cain International Gap Year program?

(Sachi)

This is something I struggled to answer myself because I don’t think it was one defining factor, and it was something that simmered in my mind for a long time. And even when I made that concrete decision to take a gap year, I still did not fully process it. I think I’m doing that finally now, almost 70 percent the way through with my gap year. But I think the first time I was introduced to it was at Discovery Weekend, and I didn’t even start to consider it as a viable option for myself until that weekend. And meeting some scholars who had been on gap years, talking to Ann Smith, who recommended it. I think it’s one of her top recommendations to take that time off. So yeah, it was just something that was simmering after Discovery Weekend. I was still considering whether I’d even accept the scholarship or not. And I think it was at a Charlotte alumni event where my parents met Ann Smith, and she brought up the idea of a gap year as well. And then on the car ride home, when they were like, “Oh, this might be something you might want to look into.” Then it finally started falling into place because I was really apprehensive about what my parents would think because, as the child of Indian immigrants, that’s not something that most of them see in their children’s future, to take time off from school. That’s a very bizarre idea. But I think talking to Ann, understanding all the resources that would be available to me, how it would be very hard for me to fall on my face. Even if I did, I would learn something from that with something very valuable. That’s ultimately what led me to take that step and defer my enrollment for a year.

(Allyson)

I can speak for at least myself in regretting not taking a gap year, especially after looking at your photos. I was just saying this before, but I was in midterm season, and I would just see all your photos, and you just traveling around the world, and I was like, “Wow, that could be me.”

(Sachi)

I was in that position last year, too, when I was deciding whether to take the scholarship, I finally started following some of the current gappers, and seeing their pictures was like… I was like, “Wait, that could be me somehow. I don’t really know what steps I need to do to get there, but it could be me because people have done it before.” But also, social media can be deceiving. It’s really cool to see those glamorous shots in these cool locations. But I think we’ll get into this. But there are a lot of aspects to a gap year that are unexpected and can be difficult to manage. It’s not all what you see on social media.

(Allyson)

Then, on that note, I’m assuming that you planned quite a bit for all your travels ahead of time, but what were the spontaneous moments that weren’t necessarily planned? As well as how much planning did really go into it. Was it months, weeks? Can you quantify that?

(Sachi)

I think after speaking to a lot of my fellow gappers when we met up in Tanzania in January, I realized that I probably was one of the few scholars who did less planning. I met some people who applied to college, and even the Morehead-Cain, knowing that they would take a gap year. And they had been planning for, I guess, a year at that point, just applying to programs and stuff like that. But for me, it was a lot more spontaneous. I didn’t think I’d do any international travel until that very Tanzania trip. I must thank my parents for this, but I got to backpack Europe for two months before that, from September to November. And that was a very last-minute decision because two of my friends that I knew from Charlotte, they’re twins. Shout out to Katerina and Philip. They were planning to backpack Europe together, and they heard that I was taking a gap year, so they invited me. It was so last minute. They were leaving in a week. And I didn’t even bring it up with my parents because flight tickets at that point were super expensive. But they had the foresight that I lacked to know that this would be a great way to get used to traveling, to deal with people who had connections in Europe, to work as a group to figure out logistics and stuff like that. And it’s made the rest of my gap year so much smoother because I built a lot of those skills earlier. But yeah, a lot of my plans were spontaneous, booking that flight. That was very last minute. I ended up leading planning for the Tanzania trip, so that started early. But yeah, I think it was a good mix. And something I learned was that when planning your gap year, at some point, you just have to go for it. You can’t expect to have everything figured out before you step foot in a country, which is scary. But it’s better to make those decisions rather than hold off and then eventually never get to the place that you’ve been dreaming about.

(Allyson)

Yeah. Then you were saying your hesitation traveling internationally. Prior to this gap year, did you travel often internationally, or how was that seen?

(Sachi)

So, the way I like to put it is when my family had enough money to book international tickets, we were always going to India to see our family. Other than India and the U.S. and some road trips to Canada and Mexico, I’d never really seen much of the world. And I was very grateful to even see India. I actually lived in India for three years. And living in India, living in a different country, opened my eyes to so many things and made me realize the value of just spending time in a different place because you come across so many things that you didn’t even know would be different or so many things that you didn’t even know your eyes had to be open to. And that’s the mentality I went into, going to as many parts of the world that I hadn’t seen already, to just hope to be surprised or hope to have my eyes opened. And that happened everywhere I went.

(Allyson)

And then you were writing in your blog post about—in Vienna—you were talking about tourist versus traveler dilemma when visiting new places. How did you find ways to immerse yourself in the local community in places that you travel to?

(Sachi)

Yeah. I think the more I’ve traveled, I mean, I did that blog post, I think that was my second stop while backpacking in Europe. I think I realized that you can’t ever not be a tourist. You can be a decent tourist, or you can be a great tourist that actually engages with the community and tries to get to know people who live there, which can be very tricky, especially in Europe. I found that it’s difficult to immerse yourself within actual European society. It’s more so the traveler community in Europe, which is also very fascinating. But I found immersion whenever I somehow got to know somebody who lives in Europe. So, one of my favorite stops in Europe was in Berlin because I met a German traveler in Italy who was originally from Berlin, and she told me to stop by and see her if I ever made my way there. And that was an incredible time because I stayed with her and her family. I met all her friends at school, and she was just my personal tour guide, telling me all these interesting facts about Germany and German culture in Berlin in particular. I learned so much about the school system just by observing her, and I was very fortunate to have some small moments like that. But one of my—some of the most valuable experiences was recently when I was in Morocco, and I was staying with a host family. That was so different to anything else I had experienced that year because it’s so different to live and eat and go to the public bath house with a local family, especially a local family that doesn’t speak English. And so, you’re forced to… Well, I had to communicate with them in French and the little bit of Arabic that I was picking up. And that was so much more immersive and so much more valuable. And I wish I’d done more homestays earlier in my year.

(Allyson)

You were just talking about Morocco. How did that homestay come to be? Is there a website that you just signed up? Or how did that happen?

(Sachi)

I was looking for… I knew I wanted to go to Morocco at some point during my gap year, but I didn’t have any connections there, and I didn’t have any travel buddies either. I was looking for some stable positioning that would make it easier for me as a solo female traveler to get to Morocco. I heard about this language school. I went on their website, and they offer ways to get homestays. I did it through that school. One day, I just randomly, I just showed up at their door. I didn’t really know much about my host family, but they ended up being the sweetest people ever, which I think is quite typical with host families. You have to be very sweet and accommodating to even think about hosting people from other countries.

(Allyson)

You were just talking about safety as a female solo traveler. How have you balanced safety with an immersive experience and meeting these new people that you find across the world?

(Sachi)

Yeah. Well, I think the more immersed I am in something, the safer it tends to be because I’m with people who live there or people who are used to traveling. And I think this is interesting, and you’ll hear this a lot from people who have had the opportunity to travel outside the U.S., but a lot of places are just simply safer than the U.S., which was a very interesting feeling to know that you could be in a public space at night. And the probability of someone having a gun was near zero compared to the U.S., where you can almost expect that. So, a lot of things were in that way much safer. I still did a lot to manage my safety. For most of the year, I was traveling with other people who had a lot of common sense and street-smart skills to know how to avoid situations like that. Then when I was in Morocco, I was living with a host family. I had a very stable schedule. I knew how to avoid situations that could be potentially dangerous. But overall, I found the places that I traveled to much safer than some areas in the U.S.

(Allyson)

Was there ever a specific moment that you’re like, I feel unsafe right now? How did you work to mitigate that situation?

(Sachi)

I think certainly there were some moments where I felt unsafe. Fortunately, most of those moments, I was with other people, and we could put our minds together on how to avoid a situation or how to deal with it. But even when I was on my own, my greatest defense was my earbuds. I would just have my earbuds in, and even if I weren’t listening to anything, it would be a way to avoid unwanted interactions without coming off as rude because coming off as rude is a way to get into dangerous situations, as well. But yeah, fortunately, most of my unsafe experiences, I was able to manage with the help of others.

(Allyson)

Then on the same note, I guess, of unsafe: when you climbed Mount Kilimanjaro with fellow gappers, how was that experience in general? Can you just speak to that?

(Sachi)

Oh, my gosh. The funny thing about the Tanzania trip is that it was one of the motivating factors to take a gap year because for listeners who don’t know, it’s become a tradition for Morehead gappers. I think we were the fourth consecutive year to plan a Tanzania trip with a hike, a safari, and some other exploration in the country. When I heard about that first, I was like, that is such a unique tradition to have. The fact that I could easily become part of that is insane. Planning the trip without the help of a travel agency was a lot, but because we had so many years of research and contacts to fall back on, it was a manageable process. The experience was quite unforgettable, as you could assume. There were so many factors that made it an incredible experience. I think what most people want to hear about is what were the views like from the top, and certainly they were incredible. But I think, at least, I knew even before I got on the plane to Tanzania that the most valuable thing I would take away was the connections I was building with my fellow gappers.

It was such a lovely point in my gap year when so many people had been in so many different places in the world, and we were all converging at one point doing something incredibly physically and mentally difficult to get really close quickly. And finally, to be in this environment where we all had experiences that we could relate to each other with. Because a lot of my year, especially when I went home for the holidays, was a little tricky talking to my hometown friends about experiences that weren’t relatable, and it’s hard to come off as down to earth when you’ve done all these things. But that was a very refreshing environment to be in.

(Allyson)

And how long was the trip in total? From base camp to summit?

(Sachi)

So, what we learned is that there are a bunch different routes you can take to get to the top, ranging from eight days to four days. And we picked the route with the highest percentage of summitting success, which ended up being seven days and six nights. So, we spent six days climbing up the mountain and then one day descending. And the reason it takes so long to climb up the mountain is because you change elevation a lot to slowly get acclimated to it, because the number the one factor that affects your chance at summitting is altitude sickness. So, I think the reason this route has so much success is because you reach high elevations, and then you go back down to get your oxygen levels back up so you can get acclimated to the altitude. And that way, you can reach the summit with more success. But summit day itself was probably the toughest day I’ve had mentally and physically. But what made it great was finally getting to the top with these people that I’d only met five days ago and really basking in that moment. It was a great moment in my gap year because it was one of the only things I knew I wanted to do when I first took it. And to finally reach that point was incredible.

(Allyson)

We met during our OL \[Outdoor Leadership\] this past summer in Alaska in the Talkeetna Mountains. We both can speak upon how hard that was mentally and physically. How did Alaska, I guess, level up in a way to Mount Kilimanjaro?

(Sachi)

Well, I think Alaska was, and my NOLS course was such a formative experience. I knew it would be. I really wanted to take it before my gap year. People have the option to take it during their gap year or even after. But I knew I was embarking on something that would require a lot more of a sense of independence and a sense of confidence that I could take care of myself. So, Alaska really whipped me up into shape in that way, and it made hiking Mount Kilimanjaro not any easier than it is, but it gave me a sense that I could do it. If I could spend a month in the Alaskan wilderness, I could spend a week on Mount Kilimanjaro. And the parallels were interesting, or the lack of parallels, because I think while NOLS was more about the journey and you had so many different goals you could accomplish, like personal, interpersonal, or just wilderness skills. There was only one goal on Mount Kilimanjaro, and that was reaching the summit. And because of that, the way we went about the journey was up to us. We could make the most of it, or we could just hone in on that one goal and let a lot of things fall apart.

It really wasn’t a teamwork-oriented thing. It’s a very individual accomplishment. But I think with the group that I was in, with it all being Moreheads who had been traveling and really cared about getting to know each other, it became a great experience in that way as well. So, both were great experiences, but Mount Kilimanjaro had the potential to become a lot more individual and maybe not as fulfilling in some ways as the NOLS course was for me.

(Allyson)

Wow. I found that that’s interesting in the sense of what your goal is during that. You’re just looking straight ahead. I’m going to summit this mountain. But it’s hard on these NOLS and Outward Bound courses, how it’s just so—you’re not necessarily reaching a point per se. It’s more of your personal journey. I never considered that. That’s an interesting perspective that you had.

(Sachi)

Another thing was, well, a lot of the laws in Tanzania make it so make it easier for you to focus on that one goal. In Alaska, you knew we had a lot of cooking mishaps, tent mishaps. In Tanzania, because we were hiking with a hike organization, they did the cooking for us. They set up our tents for us so that we could focus on climbing the mountain, which is just a very different experience because you have the privilege not to worry about your survival in those aspects and more so just staying healthy and getting to the top.

(Allyson)

Then you were saying you had other activities after Kilimanjaro. Can you talk a little bit about that? I think there was a safari of some sort. It sounded amazing.

(Sachi)

Yeah. We spent a total of three and a half weeks in Tanzania, and it started with the hike. And then, we had a couple of days of rest that were much needed before we did a four-day safari in the Serengeti National Park. And we worked with the same safari organization that the past three years \[of Morehead-Cain gappers\] had worked with as well. So, we had a great relationship with their safari guide. And that was a great experience for a lot of people on the trip who were really interested in environmental conservation and just animal lovers in general. And then we spent the last few days on our trip traveling to Dar es Salaam and taking the ferry to Zanzibar and just enjoying each other’s company, doing some sightseeing, and really spending some time together before we all split ways again by the end of January.

(Allyson)

Yeah, and you’ve done so many experiences just this far. And so, you have a stipend. For every gap year, they have a stipend from Morehead-Cain. And how do you work to maximize your budget and just plan through that?

(Sachi)

I think when we’re talking about maximizing funding, that doesn’t necessarily have to mean timewise because, technically, my funding only got me through two and a half months of an entire year. But in my mind, that was still maximized in many ways because the places I was traveling to were expensive to get to, and the experiences I was seeking out were also expensive, but they were experiences I knew I really wanted to have, and I was comfortable spending a more concentrated amount in a short period of time having the other parts of my gap year be not so well-funded just so that I knew I would be able to see as much of the world as I wanted to and have all the experiences that I wanted to. But that isn’t to say that the Morehead-Cain stipend can’t last the entire year because I have a lot of friends who also took gap years who are very creative with how they set out their experiences to make sure that the stipend did cover the entire year. And I think gap years can look so, so different for everybody. The stuff that you hear about from Morehead-Cain, including podcasts and articles, really like to highlight these more glamorous experiences.

But we would really need 100 Morehead-Cain Scholars in this room to talk about their gap year experiences to really highlight what a year off looks like financially, the experiences that those include, the parts of the world that that includes, just even personal development that people experience as well. And I think that’ll be a better way to experience it.

(Allyson)

And then you’re talking a little bit about advice and that way of thinking. So, I know I talk to a lot of high school seniors when they’re here for Discovery Weekend, and a lot of them are very excited about taking a gap year. And they’re a little frightened sometimes. What you were saying, they’re hung up on the financial aspect of it. Is there other advice that you can give to these high school seniors to mitigate their worries about a gap year?

(Sachi)

Well, I think I should go back to where I was mentally when I made the decision to take a gap year because, at the end of the day, it was a very logical decision. I could put exactly on paper why I decided to take a year off. And the way I saw it was that Morehead-Cain uniquely was providing so many connections and resources that would make it very hard for me to fall on my face when making this crazy decision or seeking out experiences or seeking out people to meet across the world. And the Advising team has a lot of mechanisms in place to give you enough freedom to seek out those experiences yourself but also make sure you’re getting fulfilled out of what you’re doing throughout the gap year. So, we have mid-year check-ins. We must submit monthly reports when we’re using our funding. There’s a lot of ways to make sure that—well, the advising team really is working for you and making sure that you’re getting a lot out of the year. And I think the easiest way to put it is that everyone I’ve talked to who took a gap year has never regretted it. And that is, I think, a crazy statistic, 100 percent satisfaction rate. And I was like, well, it’s going to be very hard for me to regret taking this time off, too. And I might not be able to see that right now, but I feel like at the end of the year, and I certainly see it already, I do not regret making that decision. So, I think if you can get into the mindset that you’re not going to regret it, all the things will slowly follow in suit. All the experiences you didn’t dream of having will slowly present themselves to you. And yeah, I think when I reflect on this year, I feel really fulfilled when I think of my experiences, and I think about the fact that I could not have had them otherwise.

(Allyson)

And you were just talking about all your experiences and being on top of the world, essentially. How do all these experiences fit into the mold of, how does that prepare you for Carolina? Now you’re thinking about registration this upcoming fall, how are you feeling about, do you feel prepared to take on this new chapter of your life?

(Sachi)

Certainly. In a lot of ways, obviously, I wanted to see a lot of the world and travel, but I knew that while doing that, I was also building a lot of personal skills regarding my ability to take care of myself, my ability to mitigate stress, work with logistics. And I think that, well, I felt that way after Alaska. And then after having used those skills in the urban world, I feel very much prepared to take on any challenges at Carolina.

(Allyson)

You’ve traveled so many places and you’ve seen so many things, and you’ve already come back to North Carolina, and sometimes I bet it gets lonely, and you’ve most definitely missed your family. Can you speak to how you handle that loneliness as a traveler?

(Sachi)

Something I realized after I came back from my very first trip, which was the two months in Europe, which had been the longest I’d been away from home, was that it felt so good to be home. And I knew that if I was going to get through this year, I had to build in time to be home and see my family again and see my friends again, which was difficult to admit because so many of the people I met up in Tanzania with or I was just following on social media, spent almost their entire year abroad and never went home once. And I felt that I was being weak in some way, that I needed to come home so often to regroup and get my bearings. But I had a countdown in my mind if I really needed it about when I’d be able to see my family next. And that’s something that helped me get through the year. And then, eventually, the promise of being on the UNC campus in the fall. Some of my favorite moments while I was in Tanzania with the rest of the gap year scholars was dreaming about what our life would be at UNC and seeing each other, visiting each other at our dorms, eating at the dining hall together, taking classes together. It was something that we all really looked forward to. And I think being away from home so much made it that much more exciting.

(Allyson)

And you were just talking about what you’re looking forward to at Carolina. Is there anything at Carolina that you’re like, I’m so excited for?

(Sachi)

If I had to condense it to two things, I would say friends and a schedule because those were two things that were always a toss-up during my gap year. Sometimes I had great friends that I could laugh and joke with, and sometimes I didn’t. And for sure, I did not have a schedule. I’m someone who thrives on routine, and not having that this year was challenging and something I needed to experience. But I cannot wait to have routine at Carolina and go to classes and meet up with my friends for lunch, and live in a dorm with people I traveled with over this gap year as well. And to finally be and have that sense of community and maybe go to some basketball games. Yeah, very, very excited to come to Carolina this fall.

(Allyson)

Well, thank you so much for joining us today, Sachi. I’m so excited to see where you go next.

(Sachi)

Thank you so much for having me.

Today’s guest is Kevin Guskiewicz, the twelfth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a Food for Thought speaker at Morehead-Cain. The chancellor emeritus spoke with Catalyze as his final engagement on campus before moving to East Lansing, Michigan, to serve as president of Michigan State University.

Guskiewicz shares with scholar host Benny Klein ’24 insights on the current landscape of public higher education in North Carolina, how he uses roadmaps as a leadership tool, and some of the highlights from his tenure at the University.

[Listen to the episode](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/kevin-guskiewicz-uncchapel-hill-chancellor-emeritus-on-his-legacy-at-carolina).

Guskiewicz received his bachelor’s of science from West Chester University of Pennsylvania, his master’s in exercise physiology and athletic training from the University of Pittsburgh School of Education, and his doctorate in sports medicine from the University of Virginia.

Before recording this episode, the outgoing chancellor spoke at the most well-attended Food for Thought event to date at the Morehead-Cain Foundation on February 2.

Modeled after the City Club of Cleveland, Food for Thought provides a central meeting place for members of diverse beliefs and opinions to participate in free and open discussions. The breakfast and conversation series is an initiative of Team Cleveland members from the 2022 Morehead-Cain Civic Collaboration program.

## Episode transcription

(Benny)

Dr. Guskiewicz, thank you for sitting down with us today, joining our Morehead-Cain community this morning at Food for Thought, the most heavily attended Food for Thought conversation we’ve had yet, andagreeing to do the podcast.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Benny, thanks for having me. I love being in front of the Morehead-Cain Scholars this morning, and it’s a pleasure to be with you for the podcast.

(Benny)

Well, we know you’re moving, which we’re very sad about, but I’m curious, who is the box packer in the family, and have you started that process quite yet?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

So we are sharing the box-packing duties, and we’re doing it slowly but starting to get some things ready. We’re going to be keeping our home here in Chapel Hill certainly for the next year and a half, two years or so. And so, we’re going to need wardrobes here and a wardrobe there. And so, we’re kind of splitting it up and be shipping things off to Michigan around the first of March.

(Benny)

All right, well, that helps me with this next question, which is tomorrow is, of course, the Carolina vs. Duke game in the Dean Dome. How excited are you for the game, and where will your allegiances lie now that you’re heading off to Michigan State? I heard Tom Izzo say some nice things about you already. So, I’m curious.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

So let me just say that Amy and I love Carolina. We’ve got two graduates of UNC. We’ve been here for twenty-eight years. We will always be Tar Heels, and we will be cheering loudly tomorrow evening, cheering on the Tar Heels, and hopefully rushing Franklin Street afterward. Coach has been great. I’ll just say one of the things that I learned about three or four months ago was how close of a relationship Coach Izzo and Coach Williams have had for many, many years. And Coach Williams called me one morning asking me if he said, “I just got off the phone with Tom Izzo,” and he said, “Is it okay if I give him your cell phone number? He wants it.” And I said, “Well, you tell me, Coach, should I give you the green light to give Coach Izzo my cell phone?” And he said, “Absolutely.” He said he’s one of his closest friends outside of the Carolina basketball community, and I think Tom Izzo is to East Lansing, Michigan, what Roy Williams has always been to our community here in Chapel Hill. And he gives far beyond just the men’s basketball program.

(Benny)

Their leadership is inspiring, and so is yours. And I attended the winter commencement ceremony to cheer on my roommate Ben as he graduated this past December 17. And I enjoyed your remarks about the taking life chapter by chapter and what it means to turn a new page. And what stuck out to me most, however, was how many deans during the ceremony took a moment to personally thank you for your service and leadership. And in that same vein, the faculty chair, Beth Moracco, wrote a public letter thanking you on behalf of our Carolina faculty. She wrote, our colleagues recognize and appreciate the exceptional skill, integrity, and thoughtfulness you bring to your role as our chancellor. Moving into your next chapter, how are you feeling? And how meaningful are these words of gratitude from your peers and colleagues?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Yeah. Thanks, Benny. It meant a lot to me. It was an emotional day knowing that that was going to be the last commencement ceremony that I’d preside over. I’ve done a lot of them because while I was only in the role for five years, if you remember 2020 and 2021, we had multiple commencement ceremonies with a lot of folks spread out across Keenan Stadium. And so, when you add them all up, I had probably presided over more commencement ceremonies than just about any chancellor here, certainly in recent history. But it meant a lot, the gratitude that people expressed, not just on that day, but over these past two, two and a half months. It’s been emotional. This is a place that we love, but we feel a calling to this role at Michigan State. It’s another passionately public university that I’ve gotten to know over the past four or five months, certainly better than I’ve known it previously, and a lot of similarities. But Amy and I will take a lot of what we learned here, experienced here and loved about UNC–Chapel Hill off to Michigan State and try to help make them a better place.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

But they are passionately public, just as we are here at Carolina, and almost an irrational love for the place, as I think many of our alums have for Carolina.

(Benny)

Sure, the magic is felt there, as I’m sure, as I know we all feel here. If I can take a step back, and before we speak about your leadership here at Carolina, I’m curious to hear more about your experience as a student. And you mentioned in your remarks to our community this morning that you were the editor of the school newspaper at Westchester University of Pennsylvania. So what aspects of university leadership interested?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

You know, I was curious, and I think that’s something that I have always emphasized to students, that if you’re always curious, no matter, not just while you’re here at Carolina, but in your first career opportunity, your second career opportunity, and there will be many career opportunities. As I’ve said in my remarks this morning, it’s curiosity that I think, as I think back to why I wanted to be the, I got into journalism. I was a double major in journalism and athletic training, sports medicine, which those two things might not seem to go together, but I then had the opportunity to write for the school newspaper, and then I was asked to become the editor, and it kept me curious and asking questions just as you’re doing right now. And so that’s what you have to keep doing, is always asking why. And that’s what it taught me when I was at Westchester, then University of Pittsburgh for my master’s, UVA for my doctorate. And somebody once asked me, “What’s your favorite word?” And I said, “Why?” And he said, “Well, because I want to know.” I said, “No, no, that’s my word.” \[laughs\] And I’ve shared that with a lot of students over the years and keep asking why.

(Benny)

You spent twenty-five years as an academic, a researcher and a faculty member at Carolina, known most for your research on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of concussions. I’m most interested today about what you learned leading, what you learned about leadership in your time as a faculty member and how that helped you manage effectively in both your role as the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and as chancellor.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Yeah, great question. And I think that I’ve tried to lead, whether I was a department chair, center director, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, or the chancellor, in the same way, that I conducted my research and talked a little about this with the scholars this morning about using a hypothesis-driven approach and surrounding yourself with people who are going to view issues or a problem we’re trying to solve in the lab through a different or unique lens. And if you surround yourself with people who are going to challenge you because of their different lived experiences, we’re more likely to land on the right solution or the right answer to whether it’s a research problem we’re trying to solve or an issue on campus. That’s, I think, probably the thing I’ve learned the most is I’ve bridged my passion for science and my concussion research with my passion for leading an incredible institution like UNC–Chapel Hill.

(Benny)

I think that comes across in your leadership style, the focus on science and finding the answer to the question you said, which is “why?” With the longest lifespan of any public university, Carolina has faced some of American history’s most defining challenges. Your time as dean of the College of Arts and Science and as chancellor included some of the most defining issues of the past decade. From the pandemic to the denial of tenure of Nicole Hannah Jones to a shooting on campus to confederate statues to international conflicts, you’ve held the position of leadership. From an operational standpoint, which of these was particularly difficult to solve?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Yeah. So, I’ve always said that easy is boring. And we certainly have had our share of challenges. But I’ll tell you, on the other side of every one of those challenges, we have found opportunities, opportunities to improve Carolina, to get better as a leadership team and to provide more opportunities for our students and our faculty and staff. And so, I’m a better chancellor today, a better soon-to-be president at Michigan State in the next few weeks than I was three years ago, five years ago when I started, because of those challenges and the way in which we responded to them. You mentioned the fact that, yes, we’re the oldest public university in the nation. We’re 230 years old. And I’ve said over and over, and I mentioned this in a campus message back in December, that when you’re 230 years old as an institution, we are all interims. As we think about it, I’ve been fortunate to be the chancellor here for five years, but that’s a sliver of time in those 230 years. And it’s important that we make sure that the impact that we have on this institution for the next 230 years will be felt by generations of Tar Heels.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

I don’t think there’s one of those challenges that I would say was one that I learned more from than another. They were each different in their own way. But I think the common thread between all of them is that we, I think, quickly responded to it, acknowledged that we could have done better if, in fact, we could have, and brought the right people to the table to help get us to the right place. And I think if I regretted anything, it would have been in a couple of occasions, maybe messaging the potential consequences of a bad decision earlier than perhaps I did. And so, because I learned from that, I’ll be better at this in the future.

(Benny)

It certainly resonates with me, the idea of being a steward for this university. And I feel that. Is there anything that you would want folks to know about how you approach these problems. And President Hans of the UNC System came to speak with us a few weeks ago, and he talked about leading with curiosity, trying to understand what’s in front of us and finding some sort of truth. And so, I’m wondering if there’s anything that you would like to share about, not a specific challenge, but how you approach and your leadership team approaches these things that you feel get lost in the noise.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Yeah. So, some of these issues we face intersect with the challenges that our society, in general, faces in a very divided country, around some political issues and some social justice issues. We talked a bit about that earlier this morning. And as a campus leader, it’s important that while we all have opinions, we all want to have values that are so important to us. We have to be careful to allow all those voices to show up if people want to share them. And if a leader, campus leader, a chancellor, a president, is out there condemning a particular point of view, it can shut down the other side when this should be a place that we bring expertise and experiences into these conversations to help society learn from them and to maybe help policymakers find the right path to a new law that might need to be put forward or a way that you would interpret an existing law. So that’s the role that I’ve tried to play, despite the fact that it’s hard to keep your own emotions intact when we all have those feelings and emotions about these issues.

(Benny)

Yeah, I appreciate you answering that and the way you did. You mentioned the interpretation of the law. And in October, the U.S. Supreme Court held that universities across the country can no longer consider race when making admissions decisions. How is the University reassessing and revising its admissions process as to ensure the University continues to bring in students of diverse backgrounds, while, of course, remaining in compliance of the law?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Yeah. So that was a challenging time for us, but again, an issue of which there were differing opinions on. And so, when that opinion came down in June, June 29 of this past year, we needed to have a roadmap. I talked about the importance this morning of having a game plan, a roadmap to move forward. And I started off by saying that we will comply with the law. It’s a new law, we will comply with it, and that we will also stay true to our values and live out the mission that we set forth with this great institution, knowing that diversity is important for our students and, faculty, and staff, and that there are proven educational benefits of the diversity showing up in classrooms. And I could speak to that as having been a faculty member for twenty-eight years while also leading the institution’s chancellor for five. And so, I know that the institution will continue to place value on diversity. And I know that one of the goals, to be sure that there’s a robust applicant pool every year. I know that our applications are up again, five, six, seven percent, as they have been for the past several years.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

And so that you just hope that that’s going to allow for a robust applicant pool such that the diversity will show up, even though using race as one of the many factors in that selection process will not be permitted.

(Benny)

Admissions are up. Student enrollment is up. State appropriations for UNC students has effectively remained the same from 2011 to 2022. I’m going to throw a few more stats at you. The average salary for full professors at UNC is $167,000, far lower than the average for, say, Virginia, where you did your doctorate, or Maryland University. And to make up for this gap, faculty are incentivized largely by the research they publish and the grants they attain. And you spoke a little bit about that this morning. From my perspective as a student, I’m most interested in how UNC ensures the quality of our educators, not just our researchers. So, how does the University approach that?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

So, there’s a lot of conversation around this topic, and we talk often about affordability and accessibility. The fact that Carolina has remained number one among all publics for twenty consecutive years for best value and with best value, and to earn that ranking, it has to be that we remain affordable, but yet the quality remains very high. And to your point, the faculty is sort of the heart and soul of the campus and of the opportunities provided to our students. And I don’t want to underestimate the importance of our dedicated staff because they’re incredible as well. But the faculty are sort of what we’re preparing the future generation of leaders. And so there is a gap that’s widening in terms of salaries for our faculty here at Carolina, relative to those at many of our peers. And it’s in large part because we’ve kept tuition flat for seven consecutive years, soon to be eight consecutive years. And while that helps on the affordability front, our deans and others have to figure out how are we going to recruit and retain the best faculty when they’re being paid ten, fifteen, twenty percent less than that of our peers. So, a lot of work ahead on that, and it’s why this capital campaign was so important, this five-billion-dollar campaign, where we raised some money to support faculty, it won’t be enough, and something’s going to have to change.

(Benny)

I’m going to stay on this theme of UNC higher education and the context of higher education. In an interview with the Daily Tar Heel, you described having healthy tension with the board of trustees. But you also said we’re in illogical times in higher education. You described dealing with trustee infighting and, quote, “concerns about some board members wanting more oversight.” Could you help me understand what this conflict looks like and, in practice, what influence it has over our university experience?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

So what I said in that interview, and I stand behind it, and that is that I think all great public institutions must have a healthy tension within it. In fact, I often cite Clark Kerr, who led Berkeley and then the University of California system for a number of years back in his quote is something to the effect of “it’s almost as if that healthy tension has to exist almost to the point at which the university is at war with itself.” And that’s what helps to move a university forward. It’s never going to be status quo if there’s a healthy tension. And so, I believe that the board of trustees members, that they each independently love this university in the same way that we all do. But there are different opinions at times on certain issues about the direction in which the University should go and whether certain things need reforming. I think that, as I said earlier, all voices are important. I just think there needs to be a closer analysis around some of what is being asked to be reformed and the reality of this being a now top four public university that’s moving up in every metric possible.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

And so it begs the question, what is actually needing reformed? And so, to your question about how it affects students, I think students’ voices are as important as those in power. And if there are things that the students collectively or independently think need to be fixed or reformed, then we need to hear about it. But the vast majority of students and recent alums that I talked to can’t speak more highly of their experience and positively about their experience here at Carolina.

(Benny)

You mentioned reforming things and when we should or shouldn’t. One thing that was reformed recently was the selection committee for the next chancellor, and it was reduced the amount of people that sat on that committee, who was on that committee. Folks from the board of governors previously were not allowed to sit on that and correct me if I’m wrong, but now they’re required to do so. Does that concern you in any way?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

I haven’t honestly taken enough time to look at the exact composition. I know it’s a smaller overall committee, maybe 13 to 14 committee members. If I’m recalling, and as I said, I think all voices are important in this process. I guess given that, ultimately, the board of governors has to approve the president’s appointment of a new chancellor, I guess I would argue that their voice is already there and in the process. And so, with a smaller committee, thirteen or fourteen, will there be sufficient voices among alumni, student input, faculty input, et cetera, if some of those spots are being taken up by board of governors members? And I think there are other system-wide leaders that I think have expressed some of the concerns about that.

(Benny)

Well, thank you for going with me through some of those questions about maybe the less good, but not necessarily just some of the context. Let’s talk about the wins. And there are many of them. I’m going to ask selfishly about the Innovation Junction because I have a chance to work there sometimes through one of my internships. What’s the Innovation Junction, and why should folks learn more about it and be excited for it?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

The Innovation Junction is sort of going to be one of the most important things that we do. We’ve been talking about this innovation corridor that we’re building out here, and that started fifteen years ago with the emphasis that was being placed on entrepreneurship. And a lot of this started under Holden Thorp’s leadership and Chancellor Folt placed emphasis on this. And I tried to carry that into my chancellorship. And so, it’s not just about the Shuford program. And entrepreneurship is something I’m really proud of. I was able to get to know the Shuford family when I became dean of Arts and Sciences and able to secure a significant game-changing gift from the Shuford family to endow that program for our undergrad students. And entrepreneurship and innovation need to take place in so many different ways on our campus. It’s creating an entrepreneurial mindset for our students, but also helping our faculty to better understand the need to find ways to spin out their research, to commercialize it, to find opportunities for the impact of their research to hit the marketplace faster. The Innovation Junction over at 137 East Franklin will be that hub where that can begin to take shape and take form.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

And then as we build out up through Porthole Alley behind the Carolina Coffee Shop and we’re building that out, it’s going to create more opportunities for innovation space. An incubator where industry partners can come in and rub elbows with our world-class faculty to make sure that UNC–Chapel Hill is helping to drive the economy of North Carolina. It’s a magnet for companies to want to move here, so that’s what the junction is going to do for us. And I don’t think we’ll even realize for several years the impact that it will have had.

(Benny)

It’s very exciting stuff. What else? When you think about your legacy at Carolina makes you feel proud. And I’m sure there are many, but are there a few others that you would share?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

One of the things we were able to complete, it started when I was dean, and then we were able to get it approved and then ultimately introduced three semesters ago. And that is our new general education curriculum, Ideas in Action. Most universities try to revamp their general education curriculum about every twelve to fifteen years, and many of them don’t succeed. They start the process, and they give up because faculty sometimes can’t agree on what should be in the general education curriculum. But I’m proud of the fact that we started that back in 2016, 2017, and went through a lengthy process, and then finally, we were able to introduce it and launch it in 2021. We would have done it sooner, but it was delayed because of COVID-19, so I think that’s going to be a game changer for our students and their careers because of the way in which we built some civic leadership into it. We built more emphasis on experiential learning into the curriculum. We have placed more emphasis on the liberal arts nature of the general education curriculum and linking it more with sort of a vertical learning approach to their selected major and minor.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

So again, I’m proud of the new curriculum. And then I think I mentioned this morning with students a little bit about the Program for Public Discourse. I think this is how we’re placing a lot of emphasis on teaching our students how to think, not what to think. There’s a lot of programming around these contentious issues that society is facing and bringing people in with different viewpoints to model good, civil discourse so our students can go out and be active participants in a thriving democracy that this world needs. And it’s in some ways under attack right now. So those are a few things that I’m proud of.

(Benny)

You mentioned student and faculty, and staff initiatives and those being some of your favorites that you’ve described. The Carolina Next initiative has many student-focused goals and, faculty-focused goals, and people-focused goals. And that was our roadmap. And that was your roadmap during your time as chancellor. How do you go about forming a roadmap at Michigan State and how you build out what the future looks like there?

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Yeah. So, I’m really proud of the roadmap we built out here. Carolina Next: Innovations for Public Good. And we stayed true to that roadmap, even during COVID. We’ve reached a point, a couple of points, where we said we got to “covid-ize” it, and we did make a few adjustments to it, but we have made a lot of progress. And, for instance, globalize was one of those eight strategic initiatives. And I’ve said over and over and over many times that we need to aspire to be the leading global public research university. And I’ve said over and over, I’m like, you know what? We’ve got the public down, the public part of that down. We’re not only the first of the publics, we’re the most public of the publics. We’re passionately public. I said that a few times. And as you can tell, we’ve got the research part down. We’re over a billion dollars in research expenditures a year now. But we need to think about the global part of this. And I’m proud of the fact that when we hired Barbara Stephenson about three and a half, four years ago as our vice provost for global affairs, we really were able to stay true to that commitment, to be sure that all of our students, graduate students and undergraduate students get a global guarantee of some type while here.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

So, that’s an example. And so, as I move to another passionately public institution out in Michigan, they do have a plan, a roadmap called MSU 2030. But I’m coming in at right at the midpoint of it, where they have asked me, the trustees have said, listen, here are the keys to the place. Here is the plan that was built out, but you have the opportunity to adjust it as you see fit, you and your leadership team that you’re going to build. And so, I’m excited about that because I think it’s a good plan. What I’ve seen, they have metrics that are measuring their progress. One of the areas to mention the global part; they are probably a little further down that path than we are here at UNC, but they’re behind in some other areas that I’m looking forward to, looking at the plan and moving forward, and we’re going to build out a Spartan bus tour similar to the Tar Heel bus tour that we had here. We get out across the state of Michigan, and that’s another thing I’m really proud of that we did here, is to get out and showcase the incredible work of UNC, of our faculty and staff, to touch down in the towns and communities that our students call home.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

So the faculty can learn more about it. So, I’ve already begun that process there. We’re going to do the same at Michigan.

(Benny)

Well, and I know you as an exceptional listener, and I know you’ll lead with listening, as you’ve done here, at Michigan State. So, I’m jealous of the folks there. But I had four years of you as my chancellor, just like I’ve had four with R. J. Davis and Armando. So, I’ll say thank you for sitting down with me. But thank you for your service and for your leadership.

(Chancellor Emeritus Kevin Guskiewicz)

Thank you, Benny. And I’ve enjoyed getting to know you. We’ve worked through some of those challenges together, and I have admired the approach you’ve taken to help us not fully solve some issues but get down to a better place on some of the issues. So, thank you. And as we enter into a fun weekend here on campus. Go Heels.

(Benny)

Go Heels.

Lee Roberts, the thirteenth chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sat down with scholar host Allyson Horst ’26 to share his vision for Carolina under his leadership. The two discuss the University’s strategic priorities, with a focus on the areas of artificial intelligence, enrollment growth, investments in applied sciences, a physical master plan, the launch of the School of Civic Life and Leadership, and athletics. Roberts also responds to the [UNC System’s DEI policy and rollout](https://www.unc.edu/posts/2024/09/11/how-carolina-is-complying-with-unc-systems-dei-policy/), recent campus protests, and his perspective on free speech at a leading public university.

Roberts was elected chancellor by the UNC Board of Governors on August 9, 2024. He succeeded previous Catalyze guest [Kevin Guskiewicz](index-64.html). The immediate past chancellor was appointed president of Michigan State University.

Before recording this episode, the chancellor spoke with scholars at a Food for Thought event at the Morehead-Cain Foundation on September 27.

Modeled after the City Club of Cleveland, Food for Thought provides a central meeting place for members of diverse beliefs and opinions to participate in free and open discussions. The breakfast and conversation series is an initiative of Team Cleveland members from the 2022 Morehead-Cain Civic Collaboration program.

## Episode transcription

(Allyson)

Thank you, Chancellor Roberts, for speaking with me today. So, you’re here for Morehead-Cain’s Food for Thought speaker series. What do you hope scholars take away from your talk today?

(Chancellor Roberts)

Well, I really just always enjoy speaking with students. It’s easily the best part of the job as chancellor. I wish I had more time to do it, but I’m really excited to be with the students today.

(Allyson)

That’s amazing. And we’re excited to have you here today. It’s not very often that you get college students waking up this early, especially when it’s muggy and rainy out. So, we’re all excited to have you. But, Chancellor Roberts, I’m not going to lie to you. I don’t know much about you. And I think the student body could say the same thing. So, tell me a little bit about yourself. What are your connections to Carolina and the Triangle area?

(Chancellor Roberts)

I’m not trying to be mysterious. I’m trying to get out and meet as many people as possible. I grew up in the D.C. area. I first came to North Carolina when I was 17 years old to go to college at another school that we don’t need to mention. And then I left and went back to D.C. for law school, spent time in London and in New York, and then moved back to North Carolina about 19 years ago now. I’ve been in the private sector just about all my career, but I’ve always tried to stay involved in public service. I served as budget director for the state of North Carolina a few years ago. Just before coming into this role, I served on the board of governors for the UNC System. I taught for a while at the other school that I’m not going to name. I’ve been in and around higher education and public service, but this is my first full-time role in higher education.

(Allyson)

Yeah, and you’re talking about making that shift from finance to more of a higher education standpoint. So, what clicked for you? What made you make that change?

(Chancellor Roberts)

It’s a great question. We’re in our 230th academic year, and I’m confident that for every one of those 230 years, this has been the most important institution in the state of North Carolina. If you care about higher education, if you care about the future of this state, you have to care about what happens here at Carolina. It’s going to be the most important institution in this state for at least the next 230 years. I believe that the future belongs to North Carolina, and this university is the most important pillar on which we build that future.

(Allyson)

I can imagine it was a very lengthy process to become chancellor. What made you stand out within that application process? What do you think were the characteristics that you had that set you apart from everybody else?

(Chancellor Roberts)

I was a participant in the search process, and that question might be better directed to somebody who was on the search committee. I don’t know who the other applicants in the process were. But I hope the fact that I bring a private sector perspective, but also have meaningful public sector experience, some meaningful familiarity with higher education from my time on the board of governors, my time on the board of the community college system, my time in the classroom, combined with a love for and knowledge of the state. Hopefully, all those things made a difference. The fact that I’ve been doing the job as interim by the time I was named for eight months at that point might have been a factor as well.

(Allyson)

Yeah, I’d assume. But what are some of the most top priorities for your chancellorship at UNC?

(Chancellor Roberts)

There are all kinds of things going on all the time. But when I think about the things that we’re still going to be talking about a year from now, five years from now, probably 10 years from now, I think about a few distinct areas.

We had working groups in place to update the strategic plan in four areas: artificial intelligence, what’s our strategy there? Enrollment—should we grow, and if so, how? Applied sciences—should we grow the programs that we have now? Biomedical engineering, data science, environmental engineering—should we add to them? What would those be? And then the physical master plan for the campus.

We had four strategic working groups working on those topics. They all reported back at the beginning of August, and now we’re in the implementation and execution phase. And then two other topics, I think about, are the launch of our School of Civic Life and Leadership that is underway with the new minor this fall. A lot of new faculty hired, 12 new faculty hired since the dean was hired in March. And then everything happening around college athletics, a lot of time spent on that. I don’t see that changing anytime soon.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And you just mentioned AI. Tell me a little bit about how UNC is incorporating AI within its systems.

(Chancellor Roberts)

So, it’s a real challenge, not just because it’s a new technology, but also because it’s changing so quickly. I keep telling faculty members, if you played around with ChatGPT when it first came out 18 months ago and haven’t looked at it since then, it’s night and day different. We’ve really never seen a pace of technological change like this. I’m old enough to remember in the mid-1990s, I was a young investment banker, and that was the time of the Netscape IPO and the huge boom in the internet. People said, “In the future, we’re not going to talk about internet companies and internet strategy because that’s going to be built into every enterprise.” That turned out to be true. We don’t have an Internet strategy now as a university. It’s fully integrated into everything we do, and I’m confident that’s going to be true for AI as well.

We’re not there yet, though, and we need to make progress on at least three areas. What should our research strategy be? And that can’t be everything to all people. We need to place bets and have some focus. How do we deploy it internally to make our operations more effective? And then probably most importantly, how do we use it in the classroom? Right now, that’s very idiosyncratic. Just about every professor, I’m sure you know better than I do, is making their own decision about how to use AI, what rules are around that, and maybe we can make a little more progress on that front also.

(Allyson)

And then just taking a turn from that topic. So, on April 30 of this past year, there was a clash between protesters and police on Polk Place that involved the American flag. This resulted in the detainment and arrest of student protesters and landed UNC on the front page of many national news sources. Can you just walk me through that day and some of the decisions that you made?

(Chancellor Roberts)

So that was a difficult day, I think, for everybody. Certainly not the thing that anybody wants to see happen. That was a Tuesday. And on that previous Friday, we had seen an encampment start on the Quad on Polk Place. And we had a really good dialogue with the protesters. Our student affairs folks, our dean of students, and her really capable team had been speaking with the protesters and just explaining to them that you can hang out on quad all you want, you just can’t camp on the quad. You can’t put up tents. Whenever the protesters did start to violate that policy, the student affairs folks had a conversation with them, and they complied. So, tents were put up and taken down on Friday.

At one point, they put up an awning, I think on Saturday, and student affairs asked them to take it down, and they did their noise regulations about how much amplified noise you can have on the quad. The protesters were complying with that. So, we felt really good about the dialogue that we were having with the protestors and the fact that everybody seemed to be on the same page. That changed on that Sunday afternoon when tents were put back up. At that point, there was no way the protesters couldn’t have known that that was a policy violation since they had been complying all along. And the student affairs folks noticed that the students they had been talking to throughout since Friday were no longer the people they were talking to. It seemed as though there was a new group of people who had either come in or were just a new group of delegates.

And so, it became clear to us that if they weren’t going to take the tents down, that we would need to take them down. That was made clear to the to the protesters, and we took them down on that Tuesday morning, April 30th, which was the last day of classes.

Later on, there was the protest around the flagpole that you mentioned. And I’ve been asked before whether I would do things differently, and I’ve obviously thought about it a lot. I have to say, I don’t think I would do things materially differently if I had to do it over again. Nobody told me to do it. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. It seems like the right thing to do in retrospect. What I do think we could have done a better job with, and it’s an important lesson leading into this semester and what’s likely to be at least some protest activity around October 7th and around the election, is communicate a little bit better and explain to people why we made the decisions that we did. Communicate more in the run up to the protests about what our rules are and what the consequences are for breaking the rules, why we have the rules in place.

And we tried to do that. We put out a comprehensive communication at the beginning of this semester. Walking through that, we’ll put out another big communication next week in the prelude to October 7th and University Day, and there are two important Jewish holidays coming up.

And so, it could be a time of protest activity. And that’s not only something that we tolerate, it’s something we encourage. There’s a long, noble tradition of peaceful protest here at Carolina, and we support it, and we encourage it. We have some very basic, I think easy to follow, easy to understand rules. You can’t disrupt campus operations. You can’t threaten, harass, or intimidate anybody, and you can’t camp on the quad. We’re trying to make clear why we have those rules, what penalties we have in place for violating those rules. If people want to protest about any issue at any time, again, we encourage that. So, we’ll just try to communicate as best we can.

(Allyson)

Yeah, and we were talking about free speech. So, on that same note, can you share more of your thinking on what healthy free speech looks like on public college campuses like Carolina?

(Chancellor Roberts)

So, a college campus should be, and I think Carolina is a place for really robust dialogue around even sensitive topics like the conflict in Gaza.

I would hope that it would be a scholarly dialogue. That’s who we should be. A better, maybe more robust, better informed, more respectful dialogue than what you see, say, on social media. We already have social media. We don’t need to replicate social media on the Carolina quads.

What I hope we would have instead of name-calling and hurling of accusations is a robust academic discussion around even these pretty highly charged issues. Our program for public discourse has made some progress in that regard. But I think we all have a responsibility to try to model what a scholarly dialogue in which we learn from each other instead of just shouting at each other can look like.

(Allyson)

And the School for Civic Life and Leadership, specifically talking about public discourse. Can you talk to me a little bit about the program and its faculty, as well as its entire purpose?

(Chancellor Roberts)

Really exciting initiative, and I think it’s attracted a lot of national attention. We hired the new dean in March, Jed Atkins. He was chair of the classics department at Duke. He’s an expert on Cicero. He’s written three books about Cicero. And since then, he’s hired eleven . . . Jed and the school have hired eleven additional faculty members. They have backgrounds in political science, political theory, history, philosophy, classics. Extremely impressive group of folks. In fact, I’m speaking at an event for them later today, and I’ve had a chance to meet all the new faculty. And I encourage people who are skeptical about the school just to try interacting with the faculty, at least read their bios, understand what their backgrounds are and what they’re teaching, because it’s an extremely impressive group of intellectuals who are here to undertake meaningful scholarship. We have the minor up and running, three classes, heavily oversubscribed. We’ll have the major here shortly, so we’re excited about it.

(Allyson)

Yeah, we actually have John Rose now on our staff for Dialogue and Discourse. We’re very excited to have him, and we’ve heard great things from him. But also taking another shift. With the recent decision to repeal DEI offices and positions across the UNC campus, how will you ensure that all students of all backgrounds succeed and feel supported on campus?

(Chancellor Roberts)

When you say the UNC campus, it was really a UNC System policy. We’re part of a 17-campus UNC System, and at the system level, so not at the Carolina level, but at the system level, this policy was put in place to require campuses to eliminate DEI functions and report back to the system office by September 1, and we report back on a template that was given to us by the system.

So, we did that by September 1. That’s a publicly available document. I think it’s important to understand what the policy does and doesn’t do. So, it clearly does not affect really anything students say or do.

It doesn’t affect anything professors say or do in terms of their classroom activity, their research. That’s all explicitly clear. It does not affect our centers, the Black student center, the Latinx center, the LGBT center, all explicitly unaffected by the policy.

I’ve been asked previously about Project Uplift. Project Uplift is a terrific program that should be supported, and I would hope expanded. It’s been around for 50 years, not affected by the policy.

What’s affected are some staff positions that have been reassigned, and some internal training programs. I think there’s been some confusion about what’s included in the policy and what isn’t.

I hope we can make that more clear over time. But look, the broader thrust of your question is, how do we make sure that that people feel welcomed at Carolina? And we don’t have a more important challenge than that.

This is the University of North Carolina. It was founded to be the university of the people. And I would be the first to acknowledge, because it’s historical fact, that we haven’t always done as good a job of that as we could have or should have. It’s a long and complicated history over our last 230 years. But to me, that’s even more reason why we need to work as hard as we possibly can now to recruit a student body that looks like North Carolina, that reflects North Carolina.

Everyone who lives here knows how quickly our state is growing and changing, and we have an obligation to reflect that, really a moral trust with the people of the state to reflect the state as it changes and grows. We can’t just reflect it on paper.

We have to make sure that when students get here, they feel welcomed as though they belong, as though this is a place where they can flourish and thrive.

(Allyson)

Overturning of affirmative action has really hit UNC very hard. I think the recent stats just came out, and there’s dramatic lowering of students of color on campus. How are we ensuring diversity within both students and faculty on campus?

(Chancellor Roberts)

I think we need to do a much more aggressive job in outreach and in recruiting. I think of it in three categories. The outreach is part of it and going out and encouraging people not only to apply to Carolina, come to Carolina as faculty and staff members, but also trying to get more of them who are accepted to come. I’ve talked with the Alumni Committee on Racial and Ethnic Diversity about this. Can we call accepted students and convince them to accept their offer to come to Carolina? Nothing bugs me more than a student who gets into Carolina who then decides to go somewhere else. We could do a better job recruiting those students after they’ve been accepted.

Part of that, too, is the great story that we have to tell about access and affordability. It’s not as well-known as it should be. We have polling data that shows a lot of North Carolinians think a Carolina education is out of reach. A meaningful percentage of people think we’re a for-profit organization. At the same time, we have had flat tuition for 8 years, flat in nominal terms, meaning in real terms, it’s actually gotten less expensive by about 20 percent over those last eight years in-state tuition. We give away $200 million a year in financial aid. We’ve got these exceptional financial aid programs, including the Carolina Covenant, the Blue Sky Scholars, the Tar Heel Guarantee, we just need to get the word out about those more effectively. So as many people as possible realize that Carolina education can be for them, and it can be affordable. And then the third part is when people get here making sure they feel like they have a way to plug in and they can belong. We have almost 900 student organizations on campus. Hopefully, there’s something for just about everybody. That could be a service organization, it could be Greek life, it could be an intramural sport. And part of that, too, is just being more thoughtful about our accommodations. I met with the Muslim Student Association a couple of weeks ago to talk about serving more halal meals in the dining hall. Those are the things we need to continue focusing on to make as many students feel as welcome as possible.

(Allyson)

We mentioned Carolina’s history. The school was founded in 1789. As we both know, Carolina has an immensely complicated history, one that includes racism, enslavement, and campus violence since its establishment. Are there any initiatives or programs that you’d like to point to for students to learn from this history?

(Chancellor Roberts)

Well, I think Carolina does a pretty good job of making its history accessible to students, but it’s there if you’re interested is what I would say. As a student, you might have a better perspective on whether the orientation process does an effective job teaching students about the complexities of Carolina’s history. But we have the Commission on History, Race, and the Way Forward, which made some important recommendations that are in the process of implementation. I think our centers, like the Black Student Center that I mentioned, provide some helpful historical context. But that’s something that you never cross off your list. You never say, all right, we’ve done a good enough job providing historical context, and now we can move on to something else. That’s always going to a work in progress.

(Allyson)

Do you think it should be some mandatory course or something to learn about the history of Carolina? Because I didn’t know anything coming on campus. It was until I took a course this year that I was like, gosh, this is who the buildings are named after and so forth. Should that be required, do you think?

(Chancellor Roberts)

I try to stay away from telling the faculty what to do and mandating anything around the curriculum. It’s really not my role. That’s a question for the faculty. But I absolutely think it’s important for students to have the ability to learn as much about Carolina’s history as they’re interested in learning.

(Allyson)

And then just taking one last shift, what legacy do you hope to leave at Carolina during your tenure?

(Chancellor Roberts)

I just started. I became permanent chancellor in August when I talked about the four working groups around AI, enrollment, applied sciences, our physical master plan, the launch of the School of Civic Life and Leadership, and all the upheaval around college athletics. I think those are still things we’ll be talking about years from now. But the best thing you can say about anybody is that they left the place a little bit better than they found it. And if people are able to say that about me, then I’ll feel like I’ve done a good job.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And then my last question, which is a staple question for this podcast, what has been your favorite Carolina memory so far?

(Chancellor Roberts)

I got to tell you, there have been quite a few, but convocation, where all the new students were coming in. I had just been named permanent chancellor, and coach Erin Matson, our incredible field hockey coach, was the speaker. And just being there in the Smith Center with all the new students, feeling like a freshman myself, that was a pretty exciting day.

(Allyson)

That’s amazing. Thank you, chancellor, so much for joining me today.

(Chancellor Roberts)

Thank you so much for having me.

# The Catalyze podcast: Scholar stories: Celebrating 50 years of the Morehead-Cain Summer Enrichment Program
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Sahil Kapadia ’28 (middle) and fellow Morehead-Cain Scholars on their Outdoor Leadership expedition in Lake Superior during summer 2024.

As Morehead-Cain celebrates 50 years of the [Summer Enrichment Program](https://www.moreheadcain.org/impact-experience/scholar-experience/summer-programs/), we asked scholars to share a few of their highlights from the past year. This episode is hosted by Allyson Horst ’27 of the Scholar Media Team.

First up, we hear from Sahil Kapadia ’28 about his Outdoor Leadership expedition trekking around Lake Superior, followed by Carolina Hoyt ’28 and her expedition in the Talkeetna Mountains of Alaska. Next, Amanda Jesuca ’27 shares about making surprising connections during her Civic Collaboration summer working at Policy Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio.

Charles Konkolics ’26 and Stella Smolowitz ’26 take us to snow-capped mountains in New Zealand on their Global Perspective, where they stumble upon some unexpected creatures along the way.

Finally, we hear about the Professional Experience summer from Owen Gast ’25, who worked at Chicago Public Schools, and Jake Rose ’26, who designed 3D-printed prosthetics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

You can hear more stories like these in Morehead-Cain’s forthcoming Year in Review, releasing later this December.

## Episode transcription

(Allyson)

Welcome to Catalyze. I’m Allison Horst in the class of 2027. As Morehead-Cain celebrates 50 years of the Summer Enrichment Program, we asked scholars to share a few of their highlights from this past year. First up, we hear about the Outdoor Leadership summer, where scholars spend several weeks in the wilderness on a leadership course that tests their limits and inspires self-discovery. Here’s Sahil from the class of 2028, sharing about his experience in Lake Superior.

(Sahil)

As a cold rain began to pour, we stood on the pebble-strewn shore of Lake Superior, the chill seeping through our soaked kayak shoes. The exhaustion from our 15-mile kayak journey weighed heavily on us, each drop of rain adding to our fatigue. The air was dense with the scent of rain and the earthy aroma of the forested shoreline. Just as the gloom seemed all-consuming, we lifted our weary eyes to a breathtaking sight. A vivid double rainbow arched across the sky, its colors growing against the dark stormy backdrop. It felt like a promise from Mother Nature, a beacon of hope amidst our struggles. The water, cold and unyielding, lapped at the shore, its icy touch a stark reminder of our harsh journey. Yet, the sight of the rainbow brought a glimmer of warmth, a hint that perhaps the sun would soon break through the clouds, offering a much-needed respite.

(Caroline)

My name is Caroline Hoyt from the class of 2028, and I’m on my Outdoor Leadership summer in the northern Talkeetna Mountains of Alaska. Right now, I’m watching my fellow Skittles-colored scholars scout a good path for us to head down a drainage. Shout out to Naila Moloo, who is currently sitting with me as we take a break from wreaking absolute havoc on our bodies. It’s raining, and these Goretex pants should be ashamed of themselves. We are all completely soaked. The thick fog is making today quite the challenge. There’s not much of a view to admire currently, but at least the company couldn’t be better. Shout out to Noah, Randy, Vicky, Ryan, and Naila for being the absolute best hiking group.

(Allyson)

The second summer is Civic Collaboration, where teams of scholars embed themselves in cities throughout North America to investigate community challenges and propose real solutions. Here’s Amanda from the class of 2027, sharing about her work at Policy Bridge in Cleveland, Ohio.

(Amanda)

Under the backdrop of a warm summer night in Cleveland, you run back into an event just to see one person getting ready to go into the car. I turned and I see one of my Civic Collaboration team members, Giang, bringing a young black gentleman towards us. He later introduces himself as Peter Lawson Jones, an actor who is starring opposite Tom Hanks in A Man Called Otto. Those moments would lead us to a whirlwind of experiences with Mr. Jones, including hearing his legacy as a congressman representing Ohioans and even joining us for our final presentation. Through that one act of kindness from my team member to bring joy to another one of my team members who was interested in acting space, it sparked a joy and curiosity that would stay with us for the entire summer.

(Allyson)

The third summer is Global Perspective, where scholars travel around the globe to dig into an area of personal interest. Here’s Charles and Stella from the class of 2026 sharing about their time in New Zealand.

(Charles)

Picture this: 8:00 a.m. Wānaka, New Zealand. The sky lights up pink as the sun slowly rises behind the snow-capped mountains. Our ten-mile hike up Roy’s Peak led to this moment.

(Stella)

We started at 5:00 a.m., when we quietly packed our hiking bags and tied our boots, careful to not wake up the others in our hostel. We start trekking in the pitch black when suddenly I see pairs of glowing white eyes staring back at me. Ah! Freaked out, I grabbed Charles.

(Charles)

Stella, there are no predators in New Zealand. I shine my headlamp on the eyes and see a long, pointed nose. Of course, a sheep. Did you know that sheep outnumber Kiwis eleven to one in New Zealand?

(Stella)

Phew. Let’s keep going. Soon, I’m sweating as the trail continues to climb. The crunch of the snow under our boots doesn’t make it any easier. Luckily, the views distract us as the sun starts rising over the Wānaka peaks. Excitedly, we realized we might make it to the lookout before the sun rises.

(Charles)

Quick, we’re almost there. Stop taking pictures. We hike for fifteen more minutes, anticipating the TikTok-famous photo spot. We arrived just in time to see the orange streaks start to pepper across the pink sky. For two yappers, we were speechless.

(Stella)

From the lookout, we can see Lake Wānaka and feel small compared to the mountains fully surrounding us. In every direction, purple mountains reflect the rising sun.

(Charles)

Amidst our “oohs” and “aahs,” I start to juggle, continuing my tradition of juggling on peaks I summit. At 5,177 feet, we tower over the clouds.

(Allyson)

Finally, in the Professional Experience summer, scholars begin to explore the transition from Carolina to the working world by pursuing a professional internship.

(Owen) My name is Owen Gast. I’m from the class of 2025, and for my Professional Experience summer, I worked in the central office of Chicago Public Schools. Since coming to Carolina, I’ve become fascinated by education policy and decided to pursue a career in school district administration. My Professional Experience summer allowed me to experience firsthand what it’s like to work in this environment. Chicago Public Schools is the third largest school district in the United States, employing around 41,500 professionals who serve over 323,000 students throughout the city.

I was honored to work with the talent office on several projects related to performance management, professional development, and leadership opportunities for educators. During my summer, I did a lot of work around performance management practices and produced deliverables to help employees set smart goals at the beginning of each year. I also helped streamline the FAQ page, email communications, and application materials for a district-wide continuing education program for teachers. My internship allowed me to immerse myself in the CPS community as I volunteered at outreach events in several different Chicago neighborhoods to help distribute backpacks and school supplies to families. I was also able to experience high-level debates around key district issues by attending CPS board meetings and public negotiation sessions with the Chicago Teachers Union.

It was fascinating to discuss my takeaways from these experiences with my coworkers and how district leaders think about issues I’ve studied in my classes. This was a hugely impactful summer for me. I left CPS with a strengthened passion for public education and a renewed sense of purpose in the fight for equitable high-quality schools. I came to Chicago in the midst of a complex budget crisis, major union negotiations, and a transition to a partially elected school board. The leaders around me navigated these difficult circumstances with skill and determination and never lost sight of the larger mission to serve students and families. I am inspired by their efforts and remain committed to joining them in this important work. I am extremely grateful, of course, to the Morehead-Cain Foundation for making this, and so many other opportunities, possible for me.

(Jake)

I’m Jake Rose from the class of 2026, and over the summer, I had the incredible opportunity to immerse myself in two worlds that are dear to my heart: design and development engineering and healthcare, and exploration and outdoor adventure. As an intern with Handspring, a cutting-edge prosthetic clinic in Salt Lake City, Utah, I worked alongside leading prosthetists to develop custom prosthetics using 3D-printing methods. It was exhilarating to see the impact of her work firsthand as patients, such as an ice climber with an upper limb difference, were able to enjoy activities once thought impossible without restrictions.

One moment that stood out, in particular, was when we designed a rapidly adaptable 3D-printed arm for a patient who wanted to mountain bike. Seeing her ride through the scenic trails of the southwest with a huge smile on her face was truly inspiring. It reminded me of why I’m passionate about this field.

But my experience wasn’t just limited to the clinic. It was also an opportunity for personal exploration and growth. As part of my professional experience, I traveled to 12 national parks and four state parks, including Zion, Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and ma*ny more.*

*The scenery was awe-inspiring as well as an incredible opportunity to practice my photography. But what struck me most was the sense of freedom that came with being outdoors, unencumbered by worries or limitations. As I hiked through those parks, I couldn’t help but think about the parallels between exploration and innovation. Both require a willingness to venture into the unknown and push beyond boundaries.*

It’s not often that you get to explore your own passions and interests while also developing skills and expertise. But this summer, I was able to do both. As I reflect on that experience now, I realize it’s not just the places we visit or the technologies we develop that shape us but also the people we meet and the skills we learn along the way.

Happy New Year! Morehead-Cain President Chris Bradford sat down with scholar host Stella Smolowitz ’26 to share what we’ve learned since launching the Sophomore Selection process and Morehead-Cain’s Community Standards, and what he hopes scholars take away from their time in the Program.

Morehead-Cain launched Sophomore Selection in fall 2023 to identify sophomores at UNC–Chapel Hill who have demonstrated exceptional scholarship, leadership, and character, and invite them to join the Morehead-Cain Program. [Meet the sophomores in the class of 2027](index-55.html).

## Episode transcription

(Stella)

Welcome, Chris. Thank you so much for being with us today.

(Chris)

Thank you for having me, Stella. It’s great to be with you.

(Stella)

It has been more than three years since you joined Morehead-Cain. Looking back, what has been your favorite moment from your time with the Foundation?

(Chris)

Honestly, Stella, my favorite moments at the Foundation are the little day-to-day interactions that happen as I go about my life here in Chapel Hill and my work here in the building. As an example, last Friday, I saw Larry and Dershie McDevitt. Larry’s in the class of 1964. He’s the former mayor of Asheville, and he was here on campus. So, we had the opportunity to catch up and talk about some of the challenges facing his city and just see the positive energy that someone like Larry brings to the challenges of this time every single day.

And also, last weekend, one of your classmates, Diamond Moore from the class of 2027, was texting me from South Africa, where I used to live, from an art auction and sharing with me that she had met one of my favorite artists, Blessing Golbeni. So those types of things just make me happy and inspired every single day. This is an amazing community to be a part of.

(Stella)

Awesome, and I love that you touched on community, which I think is such an important value we have here at the Foundation and in Morehead-Cain in general. How have you observed Scholars and alumni coming together over the past year?

(Chris)

Well, I’d probably be remiss, Stella, not to start with the support we received from all quarters of our community after the passing of Brook Cheuvront in the class of 2026. It was a tragic loss for all of us, and for your class in particular, and the way in which alumni from all over the world reached out to lend a hand and a note of support, really inspired me and seemed like a uniquely Morehead-Cain experience. Also at that time, for example, we were in London. Megan was there with David Greer, and they were celebrating the 55th anniversary of the British Programme. We had alumni tour in London, and they invited a number of your classmates along to join that experience so that those classmates who had lost a friend could be enveloped in Morehead-Cain love over the course of that time, which I thought was wonderful. Each day here, I’m reminded of the very, very inspiring, influential community that we’ve gathered around Morehead-Cain, but also the ways in which the shared values of that community extend across generations.

One of the most inspiring weekends of 2024 for me was the 50th anniversary of Harvey Kennedy’s graduation. It was a Black alumni-organized celebration of 50 years of Black alumni at Morehead-Cain. We got to hear amazing stories from the likes of Harvey in the class of 1974, Karen Stevenson from the class of 1979, and others about their experiences at Carolina. And it was this uplifting experience that not only helped me understand the amazing journey that this community and this University have been through over the past 50 years, but also the depth of bonds and the shared experience that exists, whether you were among the first scholars to do summer programs, as Karen was, or if you’re walking this campus as a first-year college student in the class of 2028.

(Stella)

Amazing. It’s so beautiful to hear more about those methods of community. And I think one of my favorite events of the year and the way that I really see community here at the Morehead-Cain Foundation is when we have Fall Banquet, and we’re recording this episode one week after Fall Banquet this year. And as is Morehead-Cain tradition, we were introduced to the class of incoming Scholars, which included the class of 2028 and the new sophomores in the class of 2027.

Morehead-Cain launched the Sophomore Selection in fall of 2023. Can you describe the reactions you received post-launch and how you might have incorporated that feedback into this past year’s selection process?

(Chris)

Well, I want to start by welcoming the new sophomores in the class of 2027 to the Foundation. They are a remarkable group, and I look forward to you and your classmates getting to spend time with them in the same way that you’ve had the opportunity to get to know your classmates in the class of 2026, who I think have added immeasurably to our community and culture here.

When we started this initiative, we said that we wanted to create, not a second chance to apply for Morehead-Cain, but a second opportunity for Morehead-Cain to identify and invest in extraordinary talent that would go on to shape thriving communities here at this university and across our nation and around the world. And what we’ve seen is that that has borne out in ways that I think we didn’t fully imagine. We ask faculty and staff at the University to nominate outstanding first-year students that they worked with, and then we have the opportunity to meet those students and get to know a subset of them at a Finalist Weekend—that that looks just like your Finalist Weekend. It takes place at the Carolina Inn, interview with a selection committee, a group exercise, and the like.

80 percent of the candidates that are nominated to Morehead-Cain by our faculty and staff, and this year, we got to know over 190 of them. 80 percent of them were people we’ve never met before. They are truly a new pipeline into our Program, and that’s really exciting.

I think the most unexpected element of this has been the response from those faculty and staff to the initiative. We have received so many delightful notes from UNC professors and UNC staff members who have admired Morehead-Cain and Morehead-Cain Scholars for many years and are so grateful for the opportunity to celebrate one of their students who really inspired them by nominating them for Morehead-Cain. And I think this deepens our relationships across the University in a way that benefits every scholar who’s part of the Program. So, as you get to know the new scholars in the class of 2027, I know you’ll discover amazing things about them, just as you discovered amazing things about your classmates. And I know that they’ll take every opportunity to invest in the Morehead-Cain experience. They will go on an Outdoor Leadership experience over spring break. Many of them will opt into doing Civic Collaboration with their first-year classmates, and they will have the professional experiences, global experiences, and access to Lovelace Fund that have really been hallmarks of this Program for years.

(Stella)

Yeah. It has been so beautiful to see the sophomores that have integrated into my class; to see those sophomores go in the Civic Collab and that has been really cool to see that community. And then, I met the the finalists as per tradition at Sutton’s. And it was so cool to get to meet a new cohort of students that I’m really excited will be joining the class under me. Looking into the future, how do you hope this Program evolves?

(Chris)

Well, I think what the Program has demonstrated to us is that there is extraordinary talent at UNC, which we knew, and that it’s worth investing in. So, the trustees have made a commitment to continue this Program another year after your classmates in the sophomore selection from the class of 2026 graduate. We’ll do a comprehensive review of the Program, and then we’ll determine what we think is the appropriate size over the long term. But having this process creates an opportunity for immediate investments that support our first year process as well. So, for example, when we meet sophomores who attended nominating schools that chose not to nominate anyone, that is an opening for us to go to that school and say, “We’ve just met this extraordinary candidate. And we are so inspired by the way in which they are leading at Carolina. And we’d like to see you nominate young people like this for Morehead-Cain.” It’s an opportunity for us to go to schools across North Carolina and talk to them about the candidates that we’re meeting and help them understand who we think will actually thrive at Carolina and as a Morehead-Cain Scholar at Carolina. And so, I hope what we’ll see in the Sophomore Selection process is not only a pipeline of amazing talent into Carolina, but a continuous stream of innovation that affects our selection of first years. For the last two years, we’ve tried some new selection tools at the sophomore process. We’ll roll out those selection tools for first-year candidates for the first time when we return to in-person Final Selection on the first weekend of March in 2025 for the class of 2029.

(Stella)

That’s amazing. And you really led perfectly into my next question about new innovations. In the first year of the Sophomore Selection process, I was totally amazed when I looked at the stage of Fall Banquet of the diversity of this new class. It has 73 scholars that represent 24 North Carolina counties, 17 U.S. states and territories, and eight countries. As you know, alumni are always curious about how scholars are selected. Other than the tools that you’re using from the Sophomore Selection and implementing into the first-year selection, are there any new innovations, in the past few years, that you’ve implemented that have added to what has always been kind of a complex process in selections?

(Chris)

Thank you for asking. I think that always at Morehead-Cain there are two key innovations that set us apart from the rest of the college admissions ecosystem. The first is the use of time. We have candidates who write an application on October 1st. Typically, that two-dimensional application is reviewed by a college admissions office and a decision is made. We’re able to follow up with that candidate over the course of time. We’re able to ask them in March, ‘“What have you done with this thing that you’re interested in?” We’re able to ask them “This thing, this impact that you host hoped to have, how have you continued to pursue that?” “How have you had that impact over the course of your senior year in high school?” And that’s intensely powerful in identifying the type of leadership and character that we are looking for. And we’re able to layer on top of that a number of readers and perspectives on each candidate. We can get diverse perspectives on each candidate by the use of our alumni in the selection process. So, our semifinalist interviews, as an example, ensure that every one of our candidates is seen by tens of alumni and evaluated relative to other candidates that they are observing. And overall, over the course of the process, every one of our candidates will have over 20 sets of eyeballs, evaluating them, and that ensures that we eliminate bias. It ensures that we’re able to capture perspective. And I think that’s an innovation that we can never lose here at Morehead-Cain.

The other important innovation that we’re focused on is about building the top of the funnel, and we need to continue, as I’ve talked about on this podcast in the past, we need to continue to invest in rural applicants and rural nominators, and we need to continue to build affiliate partners who will nominate extraordinary candidates into our funnel. I look at our relationship with the Boys and Girls Clubs, for example, and see the quality of candidates that they nominate into our process as people who have pattern recognition from working with large numbers of young people and who’ve invested in understanding Morehead-Cain. And I think, how do we find 10, 20, 30, 40 more organizations like that locally, nationally, internationally, that can help identify the most promising young leaders and pull them into our pipeline so that we can invest in getting to know them with large numbers of eyeballs and over an extended period of time in their final year of high school.

(Stella)

Amazing. Thank you so much for sharing about that, and I love that approach of widening the funnel. I think that’s, really amazing to continue to identify more scholars in areas that maybe we’re not reaching right now. I’m wondering more about your decision to have the Finalist Weekend in person this year.

(Chris)

Well, it’s clear from interactions with our alumni just how special that Final Selection experience in person was for generations, and with COVID having receded into the rear view, travel restrictions having been lifted, we feel that we can carry out an equitable Final Selection process that everyone who desires to attend will be able to attend when they’re selected as a finalist. And that’s essential for us. We don’t want to have to run a parallel process. I’ve been looking forward to running an in-person Final Selection experience for a long time. I’ve loved the energy of Discovery Weekend. I’m really excited to see what it will feel like to have 180 or 190 candidates for the Scholarship on campus together and going through that process. But I’m also looking forward to the sense of fellowship that will happen when the Central Selection Committee gathers and debriefs on what they’re seeing and shares some feedback back with our team in a way that can help us construct an ever-better process in the future. I think that type of conversation is harder to have in the virtual space, even though there are lots of benefits to the virtual space. And I think that a virtual semifinalist process reflects the way in which your generation and their generation will be interviewing for things throughout their lives. Right? You will always have virtual interviews. This is the technologically-enabled world that we live in. But that the in-person Final Selection experience is a core part of our DNA that will be fun to have back.

(Stella)

Yeah. Thank you so much for sharing that. I do think that I have not done an in-person interview in a long time, so I think this will be great to see with the incoming finalists and how they approach this. And I’m excited to see how it looks in March.

Kind of moving on a different note, I’m often studying at the Foundation and was excited to see a lot of new faces this year, including a vice president of community and a director of global affairs, among others. Can you share about these roles and how you see them fitting into Morehead-Cain’s vision?

(Chris)

Oh, thanks for asking and I’m really excited about the ways in which the team continues to grow and evolve. And I’d like to celebrate that each of the roles you just named is filled by an alumnus. So, in Jesse Soloff from the class of 2008 coming back to Morehead-Cain as vice president of community or Ben Ousley Naseman from the class of 1996 joining as our first director of global affairs. We are weaving back into the organization really powerful experience outside UNC and Morehead-Cain, but also a deep understanding of the DNA of this organization. We know that one of the things that differentiates Morehead-Cain is the sense of powerful intergenerational community that has been cultivated here through shared experiences. This year, we celebrated 50 years of the Morehead-Cain Summer Enrichment Program. It is something that you, Stella, share with those who came through this Program 50 years before you did. And it’s weaved a really unique shared experience that I think we continue to leverage in ways that foster mentorship and support for future generations of scholars. And Jesse’s attention to community, I think, builds upon efforts that Megan has led for so many years and allows us to institutionalize an investment in some of the things that we can do together in the years to come. We ran our first symposium this past year in the Bay Area. Jesse intends to continue that with a Symposium in 2025 in Georgia. We will have an amazing Forum in fall of 2025, and I hope all the alumni who listen to this mark their calendars. And we will continue to weave mentorship opportunities, travel opportunities, and the like in the years to come.

On the global affairs front, I would note that global leadership has been part of the DNA of this Foundation since its founding. John Motley Morehead III was the ambassador to Sweden, and we are really proud of the way in which we built a British Programme and a Canadian Program and then went international about 15 years ago. And we have seen scholars study abroad as part of that summer experience for many years in their global research. We also see increasing numbers of scholars studying abroad during term time. It’s important for us to have a structured approach both to the attraction of the world’s best talent to Morehead-Cain and to the facilitation of global experiences for our current scholars on this campus. And so, over the next year, I look forward to Ben both really focusing on how we might attract some of the most promising young leaders in the world into this Program, but also, how we can inspire more scholars like you to take a leap to a very powerful stretch experience abroad. I think that too often study abroad is spent with other UNC students as tourists in a location. As we build strong networks and have alumni working all over the world, I think we can create the really powerful experience of someone like you, Stella, living and working alongside promising young leaders like yourself who grew up in a totally different cultural context. And that, to me, looks like the facilitation of the type of global leadership experience that we want to enable here at Morehead-Cain.

(Stella)

Amazing. Thank you so much for sharing about that. In 2024, I had the pleasure, because of Morehead-Cain, to spend about eight months abroad in both Spain and New Zealand, living with host families and working alongside the indigenous people in New Zealand, and I could not be more grateful for that experience. So, I’m excited to see Ben’s job and what that kind of transforms into. So, thank you so much.

(Chris)

I am too, and I hope you’ll watch this space because I think 2025 will be full of new learning and new investment in our global programing.

(Stella)

Amazing. Kind of shifting gears a little bit. We’re recording just two days from what we hope will be another record-breaking Day of Giving on November 22nd. Of course, there are many ways alumni can give back. Can you share any upcoming opportunities that alumni can get involved in 2025? I know you shared about the Alumni Forum already, which I’m very excited about, but any other ways maybe that alumni can get involved in the next year?

(Chris)

Stella, one of the things I love about Morehead-Cain is that there are always ways for alumni to get involved. And we, as a staff, need to continue to expand those opportunities because I think when alumni interact with scholars, that’s when the real magic happens. There are developmental opportunities in those conversations and interactions that are really different than the ones that that occur in your interactions with staff. So, some things to look forward to. On the selection front, we will have over 300 alumni invested in semifinalist interviews and reviewing semifinalists before this podcast is released in January. After this podcast is released in January, we’ll be reaching out to alumni to ask if they would like to take one of our finalists out for coffee before they come for Final Selection Experience. We piloted that last year and every single one of our finalists was able to have a conversation with an alum in the month of January that I think reduced their nerves and deepened their interest and enthusiasm for what was about to take place in the Morehead-Cain selection process. We want to have that happen again this year. That means that we’re igniting these conversations and relationships before scholars even arrive on campus.

Outside of the selection process, we will have the opportunity for alumni to travel together. They will go to Santa Fe. There’s an alumni journey to Santa Fe in May. We’ll have alumni having the opportunity to learn together in our Symposium in March, which will be in Atlanta. We’ll have the opportunity also for alumni to invest in scholars with the next round of what we’re calling our progress conversations. I think we need a better name for it. But these are coaching conversations that alumni have in pairs with a scholar, in lieu of the renewal letter that you have written each year. What we saw last year when we piloted that was that our scholars valued the reflective process of engaging with alumni about their experience on campus and their goals for the year to come. And that our alumni valued the opportunity to engage directly with our scholars. So, we want to grow that and create an opportunity for that for every scholar who’d like it over time, and that will require alumni who would like to engage in that work of coaching. Coming back for a weekend and sharing in that weekend with you and your classmates.

(Stella)

Amazing. Thank you so much for sharing all about that. Makes me excited to be an alumna, but also all those scholar initiatives sound super exciting, and I’m excited to see kind of how they shape out. Kind of going back this year to when we gathered in the fall, some of our seniors shared a new document called the Community Standards. Can you talk a little bit more about that?

(Chris)

Sure. This is one of the things that I’m most excited about actually this school year, and something that I hope will live for a really long time. For background, the alumni in this Program and you over your first two years at Carolina previously would sign a contract that was, in essence, a set of rules. And those rules would change over time. And those were the conditions of the Scholarship. What we saw was the opportunity to not focus on that you not carry a fake ID, although I would certainly prefer that you don’t carry a fake ID \[Laughs\], but the principles that undergird them. And in conversations with staff, with alumni, and with a scholar advisory board of juniors and seniors, we built a set a one-page document called the Morehead-Cain Community Standards, and it provides four organizing principles for the way in which scholars should engage in their life at Carolina and beyond. The first is leadership as a lifelong journey. The second is conscious character building. The third is engaged scholarship. And the fourth is commitment to community. And I would encourage every alum to go on to the MCN and go into the Scholars tab, and you can read the Morehead-Cain Community Standards right there on the Morehead-Cain Network.

And I hope that over time as we implement the language from those standards into our day-to-day conversations with you and with your classmates that it will become a shared language for our journey of growth and learning together in this Program. And I also think that it should be a language that you use in giving feedback to me, right? And how I can do my job better as a leader of the Foundation.

(Stella)

I really love hearing about the language. I think that’s something that we would talk about a lot in communication of how we are really conveying our mission. And I love that that is something that has become a priority, and kind of switching away from the rules and going more into how we can be better leaders as a whole. So, I really appreciate that and enjoy that. Speaking of that, in January, we’ll announce this year’s impact educators. Is there anything you’d like to share about this initiative?

(Chris)

Well, I think the first thing I’d like to say is that every single one of us was shaped by the investment of teachers. And it is a small but important signal to very important community leaders for us to give every Morehead-Cain semifinalist the opportunity to share with us the identity of a teacher who has transformed their life and their leadership journey. And over the past few years, we’ve been able to send hundreds of letters of commendation to these teachers with their principles in copy and certificates and stickers that we know are hanging on classrooms across North Carolina, in fact, throughout the world. Morehead-Cain means something, and there’s nothing more powerful to a teacher than knowing the impact that they’ve had on a young person. And for us to create that vehicle for the scholars in our community has been really powerful.

But this year, we were able to do something through Impact Educators that I found deeply inspiring, which is when Hurricane Helene hit Western North Carolina, we as a Foundation were able to reach out to these community leaders who are deeply invested in their communities as teachers in all the affected counties. And we were able to offer them one-time grants that they could use to support those in need in their community. And we were able to, within a week and a half of the hurricane, have cash in the hands of community leaders to invest in the healing of their communities. And this was something that I never would have imagined when we started this Program, but the letters of gratitude that we have received from schools and teachers across the state for Morehead-Cain’s support of their community in this time of need, which was enabled by the Impact Educator Program, has been a really inspiring part of my fall in the aftermath of this terrible tragedy.

(Stella)

Do you have any examples that you’d like to share with listeners maybe about one of those stories that someone shared in the letter of gratitude of what they did with that funding that they received from impact educators?

(Chris)

The most important thing is that every educator uses it differently in response to the needs in their community. So, we have educators who have taken that money and invested in the things that their local resource bank did not have. So, for example, in one community, the local resource bank was overwhelmed with food and diapers but did not have blankets and jackets, which were something that were really needed because the weather was changing. And so they went and used the money, bought a bunch of blankets and jackets and brought those over to their community center. Others are much more deeply personal stories. There is there was a teacher who wrote to us about how one family in their school had lost their home in the hurricane, and they were going to use those resources to invest in the care and nurturing of that family and the two students from the school that had been rendered homeless as a result of Helene. And the ability to target the resources in ways that are needed is one of the things that these amazing community leaders provided us.

(Stella)

That’s beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing those stories, and it’s inspiring to see what that funding can do in our community, not just at UNC.

Megan will retire after 40 years at the Foundation. What would you like to share about her tenure and your time working with her?

(Chris)

Stella, I’m not sure that there will be anyone who will work at the Morehead-Cain Foundation for 40 years ever again. And Megan did her four decades of service at a time of immense transformation of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but also of this Program. And her grace and wisdom and joy have shaped so many elements seen and unseen about not just what Morehead-Cain offers but who Morehead-Cain is. At Fall Banquet, you’ll recall that I created an impromptu celebration of Megan in which I noted that the community standards that we wrote are actually a reflection of Megan as a leader. Megan started as a temp at the front desk and became the Vice President of this organization. She saw leadership not as reflected in titles held but as reflected in the impact that one could have and the work that one could do. And that’s something that inspires me every day. And I hope that after Megan leaves, we will all continue to radiate her positivity and her grace in our interactions with everyone, not only in the Morehead-Cain community, but everyone in the broader UNC community and everyone who we interact with further afield.

(Stella)

I loved hearing that story at the Fall Banquet about how she worked her way up, but it was never about a title. It was just about growing, and I really love that. Looking in the future, what about her do you hope to embody as the leader of this Foundation?

(Chris)

I hope that I will always carry Megan’s intense faith in a brighter tomorrow. One of the things that I think makes Megan such a powerful institution at a place like this one is that there are always small crises. There are always terrible events that are taking place that are affecting an ever-evolving community around an educational institution. Megan’s fundamental demeanor is one that always projects confidence and faith in a brighter tomorrow. And I believe that as leaders, we have a responsibility not only to project that optimism and faith, but also to make small steps every day to create that brighter tomorrow, and Megan does that too. And so, I hope that, as people come back to the Foundation that they’ll see that we’ve never lost that, and I hope that I will continue to project that positivity and optimism and faith also.

(Stella)

Thank you for sharing. And hopefully, maybe we can get Megan on the podcast to share some more of her stories.

(Chris)

I hope so. I have been encouraging her to do a podcast, and I hope you will encourage her also.

(Stella)

Yes. To conclude, I am sadly approaching my last year of college. If it’s possible to distill to one thing, what do you hope we take away from our time as Morehead-Cain Scholars?

(Chris)

Stella, anything is possible for you, and what I hope every scholar remembers is that the possibilities in front of them are endless and that their capability to imagine and create the future is unending as well. And one of the benefits of the Morehead-Cain Program is that you learn through stretch and discomfort. You do things that you didn’t know that you could do over the course of your four years in college. And I hope that that prepares you to continue to do that throughout your time beyond college. I observe that many students in college, as Julia DeVoe says, imagine working from the end. They think that they build their college experience around the job they’re going to have, right? And then they design every term in college around trying to get that job at graduation. I think Morehead-Cain Scholars have the opportunity to recognize that many of the jobs that you will hold in your life simply do not exist today. And that the way in which you are prepared as a scholar to imagine the possible and to lean into that discomfort in learning actually prepares you to lead in an uncertain but exciting and promising future.

(Stella)

Thank you so much for sharing that, and I’m sure that scholars will definitely take that away with them into the real world as we like to call it. Chris, thank you so much for being with us today, and we really appreciate your time.

(Chris)

Thank you, Stella. It’s great to be with you.

# The Catalyze podcast: Meet the Sophomore Selection scholars in the class of 2027
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")
This past fall, [fifteen students](index-55.html) enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill joined the Morehead-Cain Class of 2027 through its [Sophomore Selection](https://www.moreheadcain.org/application-eligibility/unc-sophomore-process/) process.

Morehead-Cain launched this initiative in fall 2023 to identify sophomores at UNC–Chapel Hill who have demonstrated exceptional scholarship, leadership, and character, and invite them to join the Morehead-Cain Program.

In this episode, we have members of the class sharing about the moment they received the news, their campus involvements, and what they’re looking forward to in the Program.

(Allyson)

Describe the moment you received the Morehead-Cain. Where were you, and what was your reaction?

(Wade)

When the finalist round came out, it came out by 9:00 a.m. So, I heard whispers through the group chats and all the other finalists that it was coming out on that Saturday. And so, I set an alarm at 6:00 a.m., woke up at 6:00, nothing. 7:00, opened, nothing. 8:00 a.m., woke up again, nothing. And then 9:00 a.m., woke up, and it just happened to be there in my inbox. It just said, “Congratulations.” I just immediately jumped out of bed, screamed, woke up my roommate, was just super excited, just completely ecstatic. Then went out, proceeded to call my parents, do the whole call all your family. But no, I was just completely thrilled. Then to treat myself, I went out and got breakfast at Breadman’s and then played around to golf and just rode that high for the entire day. It was really fun.

(Julia)

In the car during the Final Selection Experience, going to the Carolina Inn, somebody told me the exact day that we were going to get the decisions, so the entire week leading up to it, I was so nervous. That was all I could think I’m thinking about. I kept trying to get my mind off of it. I was just like, whatever happens, happens. But if I’m being honest, it’s all I could think about. The night before, that Friday night, I was so nervous. It took me an hour to go to sleep. I was like, I know when I wake up in the morning, I’m going to see the decision. Right when I woke up, I think I woke up at 9:10, and it came out at 9:06. I don’t even know how I remember the exact time stamps—that’s how big of a deal it was for me. I was like, okay, I know when I pick up my phone, I’m going to see. That was nerve-wracking, just knowing I’m going to pick it up and see the decision. I saw the congratulations from Chris Bradford. I don’t know. I couldn’t believe it at first. I was like, oh, my gosh, there’s no way I actually got it. Because it was all I was thinking about. To finally see the email, it was just like, I It was incredible. I ran outside on the porch, and I called my parents for 45 minutes. Then I told all my friends, and I actually ran to Target and got pancake mix to make me a pancake breakfast and say congratulations. It was really heartwarming.

(Paloma)

I have all 8:00 a.m.s \[classes\] during the week, Monday through Friday, which is the worst mistake of my life, but I’ll never do that again. During the weekends, I usually sleep in a lot. I woke up, and I just had this feeling. I was like, it’s definitely out. I looked at the time, it was 11:30, and I was like, it’s definitely out. I check my phone, and I see the Outlook notification. And then I just clicked on it. And then I was like, oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Then I started freaking out. I’m sure many people have said, call your family, call your friends, do the whole thing. But it was just me in my dorm room with my cat. I looked at him, and I’m like, I got it. And he’s like, meow. (Allyson)

Of all the activities and organizations you’re part of at the University, what are you most proud of? Where do you feel you’ve made the most impact?

(Jacob)

The activity that I’m most involved in is the UNC Fencing team. I spend over 20 hours a week just preparing and training and fencing. And so, I feel like that’s really a great impact. Last year, we won ACCs. It was the first time in forever, I think this was the first time the men actually won ACCs. And we beat Notre Dame, and they all had their three-peat shirts on because they went in NCAAs the last three years. And they were all wearing those. And it was at home for them, and then we beat them. So, it was just a great moment. I got a ring afterward. So, it was great at our academic dinner. It proves for the athletic department here, we have a Loudermilk Center for Excellence. And you walk in the door and out of the elevators, and there’s two trophies. There’s two Old Wells. There’s one that has all our NCAA championships, and the one that hosts all of our academic awards. And it really shows that that’s really important for both of us. And the fencing team, we won ACC last year, and we also had the highest GPA out of all the men’s teams.

So that just really shows that we’re really about the whole spirit of being a student-athlete. So that’s really impactful for us.

(Ngan)

So, for me, I definitely would say my work with Southern Futures is the biggest place that I’m really proud of. And so, as a fellow there, I do research about the American South, and in particular, I do work regarding Asian Americans in the South, who are really underrepresented in media and just in general, despite having quite a presence in the South. And so, for me, as a Vietnamese American, I’ve never seen a lot of content or media or really even archives about Vietnamese American people. And so, this past summer—I’m still working on it—I interviewed Vietnamese Americans in North Carolina, and I talked to them about their stories of immigration and assimilation, as well as finding cultural pride and how to grow into who you are now and embracing both the Vietnamese cultural parts, traditional parts, alongside with American aspects. And so that’s been really such a wonderful experience to not only talk to people who I might not necessarily get to talk to every day, but also hear all the wisdom and wonderful things that they have to say.

(Raife)

I would say for me, that has to be the Weeks of Welcome Board, which is associated with the orientation office. I was a member this past year, and I’m the chair for this upcoming year. So, for the Weeks of Welcome Board, we’re involved in planning the fifteen or so events that happen at the beginning of the year for new students, transfers for whoever. And that’s been really impactful for me —and also, I hope, for the school—in the sense that I’m in the position of getting to set the tone for the year. A lot of new students come to WOW events as one of their first social things when they get to campus. It’s really important to me, and I think it’s tremendously meaningful to be able to introduce them to Carolina in a way that sets them up for success. And I think that it’s also a lot of fun, too. So that’s definitely something that I’ve had a lot of fun with it in the past, and I’m looking forward to continuing that in a more leadership role next year.

(Wade)

Yeah. My biggest involvement is definitely in the Navy ROTC program. The whole story behind it is I have no Navy connections, no military connections, really. I literally just watched Top Gun my junior year of high school. Thought it was sick and then ended up just applying for the ROTC scholarship. Was lucky enough to get it. Went through boot camp the summer before freshman year, came in completely bald head, drilling everywhere I went, like completely military mindset.

But the Navy program here has really shaped who I am. It does suck waking up two times a week at 4:45 in the morning like today, but it definitely shapes your character, pushes you past your boundaries, and just proves that you can do a lot more than you anticipated. But this past semester, I served as a PQS chief, so it’s personal qualification standards. Basically, I taught a class on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00 to 6:30, and pretty much just taught the entire freshman class, about 15 kids, all just the basics of the military, aviation, Marine Corps, all the ins and outs of the Navy, the rank structure. It was just really rewarding because even though you’re a teacher, you’re also just their mentor. I really just enjoyed having that leadership role and just being in a position that I never thought it would be in two years prior.

In addition to that, this past summer, I was able to go to San Diego, ride on submarines, go on the back of a jet, train with the Seals for a day. It’s a very unconventional college experience, but definitely something that has shaped me thus far, and I really enjoy it.

(Melanie)

SPARK, which is a first-year retreat. It tends to be for women of color. I did it my freshman year, and I was a participant. I’m a very shy person, very introverted, so I didn’t make the most out of my opportunities there. But this year, I was given the privilege of being a counselor, and I just love it so much because just being able to see myself reflecting back on the past and seeing myself in my mentees and stuff like that, it was just so humbling, and it was just a privilege of mine. And then at the end, we get little affirmation bags, and people are able to write how they felt about you at the end of it. And people were like, oh, yeah, you were the representation that I needed.

(Leah)

I think that my role in the Carolina Harm Reduction Union has been the most impactful.

I guess what it is, is we try to raise awareness about opioid overdoses and how to prevent them, what some signs look like. And so, my specific role is more communications. So, I do presentations at various organizations around campus, specifically Greek organizations. I feel like it’s just super important to let people—not only Greek organizations, but whoever—know that most opioid overdoses aren’t because you’re intentionally taking them, but it’s just laced into whatever you’re taking. So, it’s just how to be careful, how to be aware. If you see someone else, how to know if they’re overdosing. And then we also distribute Narcan (naloxone) so that they could help prevent it themselves, too, which I think is super important.

(Sidney)

I’ve made the most impact, probably, \[when\] I did an internship with this organization called Students for Voting Justice. And so basically through this organization, they’re a non-partisan nonprofit, and so our big focus was getting out the vote before the election, specifically targeting young Black voters in swing states, so North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. And so, over the course of the internship, I had to recruit volunteers to decorate these postcards to send to 800 voters across North Carolina and Pennsylvania, specifically for me.

And so that was really fun because I got to host these little parties. So, I hosted one in the library, a few at my apartment, and I would do these watch parties for the presidential debate and the vice-presidential debate. And so, it was really fun getting to talk with my friends and also people who just weren’t super politically inclined to get them informed about how to vote, where to vote in Chapel Hill, and also if they’re registered in their hometown, where they could do that. And so that was just a really rewarding experience. And then I also had to do phone banking, which is definitely the most humbling experience I’ve ever done, but it’s also very rewarding, even if you’ve just called 50 people and got no response, but then you just have one conversation with one person. It’s definitely really rewarding knowing that they’re going to follow out a plan and they’re contributing to society through voting. So yeah.

(Allyson)

What are you most excited for as a Morehead-Cain Sholar?

(Amogh)

Definitely getting to know people, the community that it offers. And I think that will definitely grow through the experiences that I have.

I’m looking forward to Outdoor Leadership because I can really get to know the people in my class and also just the Civic Collaboration. I think that’s really exciting and, on the horizon, and something that I’m looking forward to doing, especially because I get to know other students in the Morehead-Cain community.

(Paloma)

I’m an international student, and so that means I’m on an F1 student visa, and that is very restrictive of what you can and can’t do while you’re here in the States as a student. And so, I, for example, can’t get an internship, can’t work off campus, can’t do a lot of things. And so, it was something that I had to come to terms with, which is if I come to the States, I’m going to have those restrictions in a way. And with Morehead-Cain, something that just drew to it so much and made me so excited at the idea of getting it was the possibility of, if I get this, I’ll have so much to fill my summers with and to do. Those obstacles of not having anything to do in my summers because I’m an international student, that just won’t happen.

I’ll be able to pursue a lot of things that a lot of people with a student visa wouldn’t be able to. I really like the idea of overcoming that barrier with the Morehead-Cain.

(Suhan)

Every day that I’m in the Program, I find out new things that scholars have done and the new opportunities that we have. I guess the summers and things like that go without saying. The opportunity to pave our own path each summer, design a project, meet new people is very exciting. Also, just having access to the bunch of alumni. They told us over our Final Selection Experience that there were 3,300 alumni, which is crazy, in pretty much all parts of the world, all sorts of disciplines. Having access to people who are distinguished in all sorts fields, just to have a conversation and understand what they did at Carolina and gain some experience and perspective is also very exciting.

(Sidney)

I’m definitely really excited to use the Lovelace Fund \[for Discovery\]. I mentioned that I’m a sports admin major. Sports is really cool to me, and there’s so many sporting events that I would just love to go to. Specifically, I have a mentor that works at the NFL, and she told me she could get me credentials to the NFL Draft.

I was like, that’s great. But I was like, how am I going to get there? But now that I have access to this fun, and I can plan a trip to shadow her and do things with her in person, I’m just really excited to pursue that.

(Julia)

I think what I’m most excited for is just to be able to travel to a bunch of different places, even if it’s a random small, I don’t know, city in, I don’t know, Tennessee or something, or even if it’s California or New York, I think just being able to travel anywhere and get a hands-on experience in something that I’m interested is super helpful because I’ve never actually been out of the country before. Even growing up, I feel like I didn’t travel that much. With Morehead-Cain, I’m definitely excited about the experience to have a whole summer in a new place and maybe travel places I’ve never seen before and actually be able to have a hands-on impact in some of these places that maybe I never would have gone to otherwise. I think that’s definitely something that I’m super excited for.

(Melanie)

I just feel like it’s so liberating to be a scholar just because they’re like, just do whatever you want. Say yes to everything. That is just so . . . I don’t know. I just never felt so free in my life. I know what I want to do in my life. That’s basically helping incarcerated individuals. I know we have a fund to be able to do whatever we want. Ideally, I would love to fly to California and look at the restorative justice programs there and just be able to talk to the people that are in these prisons and get to know the humanity.

(Allyson)

What advice would you give to current first-year students at Carolina?

(Leah)

I feel like in high school, you’re told whatever opportunity you have to build your resume, do it. It doesn’t matter if you like it, whatever. It’s like whatever’s on your resume, it’s going to get you into college. But then when you get to college, I think it’s the time to really explore what you actually like and enjoy doing. And it’s important not to just overbook yourself with a bunch of stuff and get lost. I like to say get lost in the sauce. You want to choose a few things that you actually really enjoy. Maybe you choose a few categories, which is what I did.

I’m like, something service, something research-based. I chose what was most important to me and just focus on that because I feel like a lot of A lot of the students here are very high achievers. So, take it easy, do what you like, and you’ll figure it out from there.

(Ngan)

My advice to first-year students would be to keep an open mind about what you like and what you enjoy.

Coming into Carolina, I had a lot of preconceived notions of what I thought I loved. And while it’s true, I still love and are very passionate about those things, I’ve grown to be more okay with exploring new fields. So, for example, this year I’m taking an environmental filmmaking class. Never in my life would I have thought of seriously pursuing filmmaking or even trying to learn how to leverage it beyond what I previously knew. And so, I think that just random exploration and just being okay with not having all the answers is a really big part of being able to grow in college. And I think for a lot of first-year students, they want to be prepared. They want to be ready for whatever is going to come for them, and they come in with these plans and ideas.

But sometimes it’s okay to know that there is space to learn and grow, and those two things don’t have to be mutually exclusive with each other.

(Suhan)

I would say to really take time, slow down, kind of revel in the moment. First year is something that’s not going to come back. And yes, there’s a lot of things coming at you all at once. There’s so many opportunities. There’s so many new people to meet. But it’s really formative if you really take time to cultivate meaningful experiences in that first year, making sure that you’re really taking time to reflect and be like, okay, here’s where I’m at, and here’s what I’m liking about this experience. Here’s what I could do to make this better, things like that. Just giving yourself grace in that time, even when there’s so much going on, even when it can be chaotic at times.

(Allyson)

What has been your favorite Carolina memory so far?

(Paloma)

In the first two months I was here or something, my freshman friend group, we all decided, we want to go to the beach. We want to go swimming. We grabbed one of my friend’s cars, and we just rented a bunch of camping gear from UNC, the campus rec, and we drove out to the beach in Wilmington.

My friend, who was very big into camping, rented out a spot for us on the beach and a campsite, and we just camped out there a night in Wilmington, just our friend group, and it was really, really fun. We did a bonfire, and we just hung out and spent the night and then came back the next day. So that is very much a core memory. When we were driving there, the wheel rolled off the car. And so that was an interesting experience. We had to go to the auto shop in Wilmington and the whole thing, but definitely a core memory.

(Wade)

I would definitely say the Duke game. That was just such a pivotal moment. I mean, that’s why you come to Carolina’s for those big sports games. Even though I didn’t get a ticket, I just remember going to the watch parties and then being one of the first people to go rush Franklin, seeing people light couches on fire, people light their shoes on fire and go run around with it. I mean, that’s the reason why you pick a big sports school. It’s the reason why people go to Carolina, and I just feel like that was such a pivotal moment and just realizing, wow, I’m actually, I’m here, I’m a Tar Heel.

And so I really hope we beat Duke this year. And for the next three years, I’m here.

(Azavia)

I was thinking about this recently, and I think it’s the combination of all of the really uninteresting moments. As a kid, I always thought the most fun part of college would be the huge things, these really momentous moments and being head to toe in Carolina Blue at a football game, or I don’t know, being prom queen or something. And the truth is, the most fun, rewarding moments are the really small things, like getting coffee. Or I lived in HoJo last year, and I lived with seven other girls, which definitely had its challenges. But it’s also a really beautiful thing to just be surrounded by amazing people all the time and all of the small interactions.

(Sofia)

So, my favorite Carolina memory so far was literally this time last year, I remember I went to the Duke–UNC football game, and before coming to UNC, I didn’t understand the hype of the rivalry. I just didn’t get it. I was just like, why is everybody so amped up about it? It’s so lame. There’s got to be something weird.

But then I came onto campus, and I don’t know what happened, but I finally understood the anger. Not the anger, but the rivalry and everything. And so, I remember that whole game. It was a mix of cheering for Drake Maye carrying our team, but then also crying because we missed a field goal. So just a real roller coaster of emotions. Then I remember storming the field at the end of the game, and you’re surrounded by a bunch of UNC students on the field, and then you got to sing the alma mater and say, “Go to hell, Duke.” It was just so awesome. I just remember that, and that was the time that I was like, wow, I’m so proud to be a Tar Heel.

(Amogh)

Actually, my favorite Carolina memory is the first day of classes in freshman year. It was actually my eighteenth birthday, and I was in line to take a sip from the \[Old\] Well, as the tradition goes. I was standing in line, and we were supposed to . . . We thought a couple of my suite mates were like, we should be in line and drink after twelve. We were standing in line, and I knew it was my, it’s my birthday, but I didn’t really tell anyone because these are all new people, and I don’t want to be like, oh, it’s my birthday.

But I was standing in line and my parents surprised me at twelve. They showed up with balloons and I guess everyone in the line figured, so there were hundreds of people saying happy birthday for me in the line while I was at the Well, and I got to take a sip from the Well and ring the, I don’t know, eighteenth birthday.

# The Catalyze podcast: Eight alumnae on was it was like to be in the first class of women Morehead-Cain Scholars
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Eight of the members of the Morehead-Cain Class of 1979 at the Morehead-Cain Foundation on September 7, 2024.

In 1974, a dozen women became the first female Morehead-Cain Scholars at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the same year the Equal Credit Opportunity Act was passed, granting women the right to open a bank account without a husband’s signature.

This past fall, eight members of the class of 1979 reunited to celebrate their 45th anniversary. During their visit, they shared memories and insights with current scholars at a coffee chat. Afterward, they sat down with *Catalyze* co-host Allyson Horst ’27 to reflect on their groundbreaking experiences.

We’re sharing these conversations today in honor of Women’s History Month.

## Episode transcription

(Allyson)

Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Allyson Horst from the class of ’27. This year marks the 45th anniversary of the first women scholars to graduate from the Morehead-Cain Program. This morning, scholars had the chance to hear from eight members of the class about their Carolina experiences. I asked a few of the women to share for Catalyze about what it was like to be pioneers in Morehead-Cain’s history.

(Joan Templeton Perry ’79)

My name is Joan Perry. I graduated in 1979, and I am now a pediatrician in Eastern North Carolina.

(Jenny Burns Petitto ’79)

Formal name is Virginia Burns Petitto, MD. I am known by Jenny, and when I was here, I was Jenny Burns.

(Karen Cress ’79)

I’m Karen Cress. I am a proudly part of the class of 1979, and I am currently the manager of special projects at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, and I’m also an opera singer.

(Mary Sherrill Mallory ’79)

My name is Mary Sherrill Mallory, class of 1979, and I’ve been the hospital clinical pharmacy coordinator in Statesville, North Carolina.

(Julia McMillan Cline ’79)

My name is Julia Cline. I have a PhD in social psychology.

(Katie Ziglar ’79)

My name is Katie Ziglar. I graduated in 1979, and I am title-less at the moment because I’m between jobs. I just left the directorship of the Ackland Art Museum, where I was for eight years, and I’m looking for my next museum directorship.

(Elizabeth Dooley Bell ’80)

Elizabeth Bell. I am chief of anesthesia for the Salisbury VA Health Care System.

(Debbie Weston Harden ’79)

I’m Debbie Weston Harden. I am a lawyer with Womble Bond Dickinson here in North Carolina.

(Allyson)

What did it feel like to be a pioneer at the time? Did you know you were making history?

(Elizabeth Dooley Bell ’80)

I didn’t necessarily think of us as pioneers because, I guess to me, there wasn’t an identification as a scholar. They didn’t make much of an effort to get people together or to identify as a scholar. We had the check days, and they had a dinner at the end of the year, but there wasn’t a feeling that you were necessarily so much of an identified group. At that point in history, pretty much everything that was happening was new. Women only got the ability to open a checking account in their own name in 1974. We graduated high school in 1975, and the first thing my mother said was, “You have to open your own checking account.” There were all these things that were happening right then. It wasn’t so much of an idea of being a pioneer as much as, “Oh, you have to do these things that weren’t available before and get yourself established.” I really didn’t think of it much more than that. It didn’t really dawn on me that it would be much more than that.

(Jenny Burns Petitto ’79)

When we came to interview, we knew there were no women scholars in the Program, and so we knew we were pioneers, but it didn’t really register, I don’t think. We were very excited, and very excited when we got chosen. After we got here, in the first year or so, there were definitely men who would approach us at parties or whatever or classes and would accuse us of having stolen their scholarship. That was a little off-putting, and we had to swallow it and deal with it. But we realized pretty quickly that we hadn’t stolen anything from anybody, that we were selected based on the merits of who we were and what we’d done and what we hoped to do.

(Karen Cress ’79)

I know that we are regarded as the twelve who broke the glass ceiling, the twelve pioneers, and maybe in a way we were, but I think the true glass ceiling breakers are all of the thousands and millions of women back in the seventies who were marching and advocating for women’s rights that eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX, which in turn changed this program. We happened to be the lucky twelve who got to stand on their shoulders and actually walk through the door. I think the true challenge was from the women’s lib-ers who fought the good fight. We were a little on the young side to be women’s lib-ers, but we reaped the benefits of their sacrifices and their hard work and their loud voices. And look at what we’ve accomplished. Look at the eight women who are here today: three practicing doctors, an extraordinary lawyer, a PharmD pharmacist, an amazing writer, a director of art museums, and then little old me who is working at a nonprofit organization, but who brought in $3.6 million for AIDS research just this last year through managing our planned giving program, and also being an opera singer.

That’s an extraordinary cadre of, I think, amazingly accomplished women who won the scholarship. To go from twelve women out of a class of fifty-four getting the scholarship, to looking out at the sea of faces today and seeing that more than half now are women is a testament to the fact that we do belong here. We are deserving of this scholarship. We are the future leaders of this nation. And that’s exactly why this scholarship is so incredibly important for both men and women, and I’m very excited to see that there’s parity now.

(Allyson)

What was the biggest challenge that came with being one of the first women Morehead-Cain Scholars?

(Joan Templeton Perry ’79)

Well, obviously, the greatest challenge was not to let anyone down. Always playing in the background of my mind was the fact that I did have this title. I had been blessed in this way with this amazing resource, and I wanted to live up to every single possible expectation that they had for me. But more than finding that a barrier, I actually found it to be very good guidance because knowing what the Foundation stood for gave me some boundaries for knowing what the expectations were and what they thought I could accomplish. So it gave me a little extra confidence, I think, actually, probably a lot of confidence that I otherwise wouldn’t have had.

(Karen Cress ’79)

For me, the only thing that I experienced as a challenge came not once I had gotten the scholarship and became a Morehead Scholar. It was in the interview process, and it was at the local level when an older gentleman hit me with a question of, “Well, why should we be giving you this scholarship when you’re just as likely to maybe not even graduate and decide to get married and have children? Why shouldn’t this scholarship go to a man who will really use it?” So it was me coming back to politely challenge that mindset is really the only challenge that I faced, and my challenge back to him was, “Well, respectfully, you’re assuming that I’m going to get married, and I don’t see that really happening because I’m a high school senior who’s never dated because all the guys are scared of me. So I really don’t see that happening. Women are as intelligent, women are as ambitious, women are as goal-oriented, and women are as capable of being the leaders that you are looking for, and by not giving women the Morehead scholarship, you’re missing out on 50 percent of the population who could be the future leaders that you’re wanting to develop.”

(Allyson)

If you could go back 45 years, what advice would you give to your younger self, and why?

(Julia McMillan Cline ’79)

I would tell myself to slow down maybe and take a year off and find out what I really liked because I was so used to doing things well and doing many different kinds of things well and doing whatever anybody asked me to do because I was bright, and I was capable of doing a lot of things. I didn’t know exactly what was most important to me. So I came to school expecting myself to do well at everything, just the way I had when I was in high school and all the years of my life previously, and I expected myself to like everything. And I did pretty much like everything in all my classes, but I didn’t know which ones really struck my heart. And that’s what I would have told myself to do, was to slow down and figure out what things really touched my heart and would give me enough emotional oomph to get through and study and be happy with when I graduated.

(Allyson)

What were your initial thoughts when you found out you were accepted as a Morehead-Cain Scholar? What did that mean for your community?

(Katie Ziglar ’79)

Well, it was utter disbelief. I remember the letter was coming, and I knew it, and I got home from school, and my little brother, who was six years younger, had written me a note, “KATIE,” in very big letters, “Katie, you got the Morehead.” Then he wrote in small letters underneath, “letter, period, is on your bed.” At first, I thought I had gotten it, and I was very excited, and then I had to go open it. That was a hard thing to do, but I got a great surprise. I was thrilled and very excited. I think, for my community, my high school had not had a Morehead scholar for quite a while, so it was really great to do that again and to be able to be one of the first women, which people were just floored because women had never been part of the program up to that point.

(Debbie Weston Harden ’79)

Coming into my senior year, I had no idea that I could even be a candidate because women had never been permitted to be applicants. I was very fortunate to have a strong committee chair in Duplin County, and he was very frustrated. He had never had a scholar out of our county. And so he allowed me and then guided me to learn about the depth of my community. So through his wisdom, I attended County Commissioner meetings, I attended Board of Education meetings, I visited with three or four of the predominant employers in the area and really got an understanding of the fundamentals of the politics and economics of my very limited county. And it was thrilling to take that through the regional and then to central \[committee interviews\]. Very intimidating to be at the finals with all of these talented people from across the U.S.

I was the first selected from my county, and I was very proud. And for me, it helped shape my entire life. The Morehead Program not only offered, of course, four years of college, but five terrific summer programs, which helped me choose and eliminate potential careers, choices in life, and exposed me to different situations and perspectives that I do not believe from a rural North Carolina county that I would have gotten by merely attending a university or college elsewhere.

(Allyson)

What legacy do you feel you and your peers have left for future generations of women scholars in the Program?

(Mary Sherrill Mallory ’79)

I hope that we have left with the confidence of embracing challenges, especially in new situations that may mean uncharted waters. I would say that we would encourage all the future scholars to take those chances to make those dreams come true, but also to remember that how we pursue those dreams is sometimes even more important than the dreams themselves. I think if we can learn to, and this was a lesson I’ve had to learn over time, if we can learn to see other people as people, to treat them as human beings, with a lot of grace and kindness and generosity, that maybe we’ll be successful not only in what we accomplish, but how we get there.

(Allyson)

How have you seen the role of women within both UNC and Morehead-Cain evolve since you were a scholar?

(Elizabeth Dooley Bell ’80)

The Foundation didn’t really know exactly what to do with us. I don’t think it was really very intentional taking women at first, and I don’t think everybody was on board with it, but it was during that time, and I think there was even a lawsuit threatened at that time. My initial interview at the county level, I recall that I came in to a room that had a horseshoe-shaped group of businessmen. When we came and they had the initial dinner, it was very cute because they just handed out copies of Uncle Mot’s speech because, apparently, he talks about watching out for women because they just want to get ahold of you and your money, and you don’t want to marry early, and that thing. That was cute. They all had a little scramble there about that. They were definitely uncomfortable and not sure what to do with us. They sat us each at one table. There was a room full of young men and older men, and then us, the lone representatives. It was an odd experience there. But it just is so nice now to see that they really have taken it to heart. You see not just lots of really involved young women, but also people of color. It’s just an entirely different Foundation than when we first joined. It just looks really like people who are involved and excited to be here. It’s very encouraging for somebody like me, worried about the future.

(Katie Ziglar ’79)

In our period, women were not necessarily entering the workforce as much as they are now. It’s a very big change. A lot of the professional schools at Carolina had very few women. In fact, going even further back, my dad was a dentist in the class of 1964, and he had one woman in his class whose name was Cynthia. I still remember because as a small child, I was here from age two to age six, I worshipped Cynthia, and I always asked him about her. Now, the dental school is more than half female, same thing with the medical school, same thing with the law school. I think it’s only \[the\] business \[school\] that is predominantly male and not by a huge margin. So that’s changed tremendously. And we’ve got women working full long careers in the workforce, even with children or not.

(Allyson)

Can you share a pivotal moment in your undergraduate experience as a Morehead-Cain Scholar?

(Joan Templeton Perry ’79)

So Allyson, rather than share a pivotal moment, let me just tell you what the Foundation meant to me during so many pivotal times. Because coming to this campus, never having even visited a college campus prior to coming as a freshman, well, actually as an interviewee, Finals Weekend, I found the Foundation to be my home. So on many occasions, with tears, with problems, I would come through those Foundation doors, and always between Mrs. Perry and MebanePritchett, they would have an answer to my problem. So to have a home here that, pardon the pun, was foundational for me was really more than pivotal to my experience at Chapel Hill.

(Allyson)

What is your favorite Carolina memory?

(Jenny Burns Petitto ’79)

In general, it was the friends that I made here. I think if you made me pick one, there’s so many wonderful memories, but my best friends were Morehead Scholars. My best friend was Karen Stevenson. My boyfriend, through all of undergraduate, was another scholar, Greg Michaels. Again, we would run into the other scholars, and it was, again, organic. We had a camaraderie, and it was always fun to talk to other scholars, if we were in class or in labs or just hanging out. That was my favorite memory was really the friendships that I made when I was here.

(Mary Sherrill Mallory ’79)

In general, I would say friends, friends, friends, and just incredible opportunities and fun in Chapel Hill, especially with our Morehead friends. One particular instance that stands out is when we went to the Cat’s Cradle to listen to a musician who was unknown at that time, and as it turns out, it was Bruce Springsteen. What an opportunity, only in Chapel Hill.

(Allyson)

[Dr. John Rose](index-49.html) joined the Morehead-Cain community this fall as faculty director for Dialogue and Discourse. The initiative is designed to enhance scholars’ ability to listen, discuss, and engage in contemporary issues.

Rose speaks with Catalyze co-host Stella Smolowitz ’26 about his approach to facilitating “charity-centric” dialogue with college students, the connection for him between theology and civic leadership, and advice for navigating political conversations ahead of the November election.

Rose came to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from Duke University, where he was the associate director of the Civil Discourse Project and an instructor in the Kenan Institute for Ethics. At Duke, he also taught courses in happiness and human flourishing, Christian ethics, conservatism, and political polarization. His research focuses on virtue ethics and Christian theology.

In addition to his work with Morehead-Cain, Rose will serve as professor of the practice at the [School of Civic Life and Leadership](https://civiclife.unc.edu/) at Carolina.

## Episode transcription

(Stella)

John, thank you so much for joining us today. Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending the first Dialogue and Discourse dinner with Abdullah Antepli about finding a way forward in the Israel and Gaza conflict. What do you think the importance of breaking bread, per se, is in building trust? Is that part of your thinking and approach to the program?

(John)

Yes, but whenever you’re having hard conversations, the trick is to humanize the other side. And there’s nothing more human than sitting down at a table and breaking bread. It reminds us of our shared humanity. And then, frankly, there’s just something relaxing about it. It reminds you that there are things beyond politics, like the family life or friendships. It makes it easier to talk.

(Stella)

Yeah, that’s great. And I feel like you have a lot of experience with that because, at Duke, you taught two classes, Political Polarization, and Conservatism. What was your teaching approach in those classes? And maybe what did your students teach you that you weren’t expecting?

(John)

Oh, I’ve never gotten that second question. To the first, in both of those classes—and by the way, the polarization class is the one I’ve taught much more frequently—I asked the students to discuss controversial things and to consider all sides of those issues. My approach, I would describe as a virtue ethics approach. I foreground the intellectual virtues, such as intellectual humility and charity and curiosity and even-handedness, as a way of enabling us to have hard conversations. If we focus on those, we all become better listeners, better conversation partners, and can make possible conversations that might otherwise be impossible or nearly impossible because they resort to name-calling or accusations of ulterior motives or simply a sense on the part of some parties that it’s offensive to even have the conversation. The approach is to use virtues, to get students comfortable, and to get students to trust one another. I think trust and virtue are very much linked. I think when you show charity and goodwill towards the other person, when you interpret their remarks in what seemed to you the most reasonable possible way, put the best spin on them, you’re likely to build trust with them. They’re more likely to make themselves vulnerable. And when they make themselves vulnerable, you’re more likely to make yourself vulnerable. And the fact that the other person has shown that they won’t use their sword, then you’re more likely to put your sword away. That’s the approach to the classes. They have been, I’m pleased to say, successful. And not because I’m some sort of student whisperer. It’s because there’s a great desire on the part of students today, not just at Duke, but all over, because I meet with students at various schools who want to have these conversations. So while there are fears and anxieties on the part of students when having these conversations, concerns about social or professional penalty for saying the wrong thing or having the wrong opinion or for having the right opinion, but it coming out the wrong way, there is at the same time, I’ve observed, a yet deeper desire to have these conversations, given in the right environment. They really do want to be real with each other and have the excitement of having a real conversation on these complicated, morally contentious issues and not knowing where the conversation is going to go.

(Stella)

Right. And what do you feel like your students taught you in those classes?

(John)

Oh, right, that question. I dodged it. First, they taught me that they’re capable. I mean, when I started teaching the class, I wasn’t sure if it would work. And every semester, without fail, by the end of the semester, my students are doing it. They’re doing it at a level that I think would surprise a lot of the external critics of higher education who say, “Oh, these students, they’re too fragile, they’re too intolerant towards other views, or they’re simply too scared to ever have these conversations.” It’s not true. It’s not true. They can do it. They can do it very, very well. So they’ve taught me. They’ve given me hope, actually, for the future of our country. They’ve given me hope that some of these more negative dimensions of polarization are fixable to some degree because there’s clearly a desire on the part of the young people to do it.

(Stella)

So I’ve heard that that is your mission in coming to Carolina and really starting these classes as a faculty member at Carolina. But what initially drew you to Carolina and the Morehead-Cain Program?

(John)

I’ve always been intrigued and attracted to Carolina’s public mission. Duke is a wonderful university. It’s a private university that educates, relatively speaking, many fewer students than UNC. While it draws students from North Carolina, it does not to the extent that UNC does. UNC exists to serve the state of North Carolina in a way that isn’t as true for Duke. These things are different. They have different missions, and it’s good that we have all these different kinds of universities. But when I consider the work that I do, namely civil discourse, creating better citizens, there is something about it that fits very well with a public institution. And I’ve always, as I said, looked down the road and thought how cool it is that you think this way about education. And I’ve always secretly desired to be a part of it.

(Stella)

We’ll tell all the Duke fans that.

(John)

Edit that out. Duke’s wonderful, too.

(Stella)

Right. And going back to your own education and looking back at it, you have a big emphasis in theology and in Christian theology. It seems like faith is an important value in your life. How does that interweave with your love of civic leadership and teaching these political discourse courses? Are there similarities between theology and civic leadership that you find particularly striking?

(John)

It’s weird that I did a Ph.D. in theology, and I teach classes about politics. I acknowledge that that’s strange, and I would not have expected that I would be doing that after my graduate work. However, there is a thread. I mentioned earlier that I’m particularly interested in virtues as a way to think about morality, about why we should live as we live. The virtue of charity, I think, is preeminent. From a Christian theological standpoint, I believe it is the most important virtue because Aquinas said that charity is the most important virtue because it is the form, the mother, and the root of all the other virtues when you start to think about it. In my classes, I always assign Martin Luther King Jr’s sermon on loving your enemies, in which he explains why and how we must love our enemies. By loving them, it doesn’t necessarily mean you just have this feeling towards them. It’s a desire, the will, to will the good of the other. When you think about love that way, you can begin to understand what it might mean to love your political enemies. This is a proposal I put before my students. I don’t require them to believe anything. I say, “Consider this. Consider this as a way for us to overcome negative effect of polarization, in which we have not just dislike, but contempt for the other side.” Contempt is the emotion that says, “You’re beneath me. I wish you weren’t here. I wish you didn’t exist. The country would be better if you were just gone. You are not a worthy conversation partner.” That particular feeling, I think, is poisonous for our politics, and there’s a lot of it to go around. I think love or charity is the counter emotion, counter virtue, to that. My interest in theology led me to become interested in charity, and my interest in charity led me to become interested in intellectual virtues. Then, like many people around 2016, I looked around the country and said, “We’re really coming apart here.” Huge problems with polarization that have only gotten worse. I said, “I want to teach a class that addresses this problem, see if I can’t get students to talk more freely.” I drew on my understanding of charity as a way to empower students to have these conversations. It’s a really charity-centric approach to civil discourse, you might say.

Sometimes people, when they talk about civil discourse, they say, “Well, let’s just be more rational.” I’m pro-rationality. I’m not anti-rationality, but I think on its own, it’s actually insufficient. When you consider what our problems are, they’re problems of contempt. You need something equally powerful that is in the realm of the normative. I think we need to be normative in the way we think about this. The other way of saying that is if we’re to overcome negative polarization, we don’t just need to become more rational, we actually need to become better people.

(Stella)

Interesting. I think that’s a really good thought, especially during this election season, that needs to be spread. I’m wondering if you see an association or any correlation between students who are religious and students in your classes who are religious and their approach to civic discourse and maybe students that are agnostic or atheist in their approach, if there’s a difference in those.

(John)

Religion is a tricky thing on college campuses today. I think often at elite schools, it gets swept under the rug a little bit. There are several reasons. I think sometimes it has the perception of being anti-intellectual, anti-science, maybe intolerant. Some students automatically associate it with a certain form of politics that perhaps they don’t like. For that reason, it can make it hard to bring up religion in the classroom, and it can make it hard for religious students to out themselves, sometimes even to their roommates. Their own roommates don’t know they’re religious. So you can imagine how hard it is for them to bring it up in class and say, “I think this because of my religious tradition.” But I try to get students comfortable enough to stop self-censoring about that, too, not just about your politics, but about your religion. When they do, I think it’s really helpful for the other students because they’re a little bit unfamiliar with the religiosity that is actually quite typical of our country once you get off these campuses. It’s certainly true of the world when you go to the Global South. I think these conversations around political topics, whenever you’re doing civil discourse, are much richer when there are actually voices in the room who are religious and will say they’re religious and explain their reasoning, and they do think different. One thing I’ll say about that is when you get into some of these really contentious political issues, if you can get beneath the platitudes on all the sides and dig, dig, dig, why did we come to different conclusions about this? Keep asking why, keep interrogating premises, and then figure out the assumptions behind the premises, and so forth. Oftentimes, you will come back to differences regarding religion. Why does somebody think that is a life and that’s not a life? Oftentimes, there are religious reasons or whatever. And I think what everyone thinks about this is really helpful to achieve that level of clarification. I mean, I forget who once said it, but real disagreement is an achievement. Often what passes for disagreement is really just confusion. You haven’t dug deep enough to figure out what the real root is. If you can get to the real root of it, you’ve actually made a little bit of progress, even if you haven’t persuaded anybody.

(Stella)

I love that. I love asking why. And I think that’s especially prevalent in our election season right now. And as a faculty mentor of Dialogue and Discourse, that will be a huge emphasis on maybe what you’re teaching and fostering those conversations. I’m wondering, as we’re getting to the end here, what will be your approach to discourse in those Dialogue and Discourse conversations? Even students or scholars who aren’t able to participate this semester, what would be your biggest tips in approaching conversations with others who have different political opinions. I think that is something that’s super prevalent right now, no matter what circle you’re in, who you’re surrounding yourself by, and how do you really do what Martin Luther King talked about, about loving your enemies. What are your biggest tips?

(John)

King says, “To change somebody’s mind, you must first love them, and they must know that you love them.” That’s a really radical way of thinking. We don’t think that way. We think, “Change their mind, embarrass them, humiliate them, cast them out, shame them to the point where they finally say, ‘Oh, fine, I agree with you.’” King says, “That won’t work because you have to change somebody’s heart. To change somebody’s heart, you have to show that you love them.” We show them, we love them, among other ways, by the way that we talk to them, our body language, our tone. When you’re conversing with somebody, you should always be trying to bring them towards your view, if you think you’re right, without embarrassing them. People who study high conflict will tell you that humiliation is a common precondition. To truly humiliate somebody, you’ll make them an enemy forever. Also, assume goodwill. I think so often, conversation gets shut down because people accuse the other of some kind of “ism” that they don’t claim to have. They’re afraid to have the deeper conversation about why do you think I’m guilty of this “ism” and I don’t? And I think one good rule of thumb to keep in mind is, are you talking in such a way that it keeps the conversation going and people are more honest, or is it shutting it down? If it’s shutting it down, it’s not working. Now, you might say, “Well, sometimes people have bad will,” and that’s true. But when it comes to having controversial conversations, it profits you nothing to insist that somebody’s a bad will when they don’t claim to be. So for the sake of keeping conversation alive, I recommend to students, give people the benefit of the doubt. Remain curious. Instead of when somebody says something you really don’t like, instead of saying, “How could you possibly believe that?” Instead say, “Tell me more about why you believe that?” See the difference? It’s the big difference. It’s a huge difference. It shows an amount of respect. I’m really curious about what you think, and it’s keeping open a line of communication.

(Stella)

Awesome. Well, John, thank you so much for joining us today. I know all of the students are super excited about Dialogue and Discourse, and maybe we’ll do a post-interview after the program and hear what your success looks like. I hope that students really do learn a lot in your program.

(John)

Thank you. Thanks for having me.

Episode Transcription

(Allyson)

Welcome to Kickin’ It in the Kitchen by the Catalyze podcast. I’m your host, Allyson Horst ’28. I’m joined today in Morehead-Cain’s Scholar Kitchen by Nigel Parker ’25 for the first edition of our video series showcasing seniors. Welcome, Nigel. Thank you so much for coming in today.

(Nigel)

Thank you.

(Allyson)

How are you doing today after our Food for Thought?

(Nigel)

I’m doing really well. It’s been a busy day, busy week, busy semester, but I’m doing well.

(Allyson)

Yeah, and you’re obviously a senior. That’s why you’re here today. Do you have any bucket list items before you graduate this spring?

(Nigel)

Bucket list items? I really want to actually go to the Planetarium. I’ve never been to that side of the building. I actually want to see what’s going on over there. That’s definitely been on my list all year.

(Allyson)

I recently went. I was just in the cubicle area. It was so fancy. I was just walking through the hallways, and it was a whole new world.

(Nigel)

I’ve never been in the building.

(Allyson)

Can you go for free? I don’t even know. I think so. Well, we’ve got to check that out because I want to go, too. Just let me know when you’re going at this point. But tell me a little bit more about your Morehead-Cain journey. Take me back to when you were a senior in high school, and you first heard about the Morehead-Cain.

(Nigel)

Yeah, senior-year-Nigel, in the midst of COVID-19, sitting at home, getting ready for college applications. I have two older brothers, so they had been through the process, but it was my turn. When I found out that I was nominated, I really didn’t know anything about the scholarship, the Program, or even Carolina as a school to go to. I knew Carolina basketball, but I didn’t really know or consider UNC as a school that was on my list until I was nominated. And I went through the process and ended up in Finalist Weekend. And mine was virtual but was still just a really impactful experience to almost compete, but be in that space, trying to make it to the next level of my education with students who were at the top of their respective schools. And learning about all of those people, learning about what the Program actually has to offer, and speaking with a lot of alumni in my area and a lot of other current scholars at the time was just really eye-opening and was ultimately a no-brainer for me. I had other opportunities to take, and my parents weighed in a good bit as well. But I think just between the financial opportunity and then the community that you build and the kinds of experiences that you’re able to have, it was a no-brainer for me. I ended up coming here and loving it.

(Allyson)

Yeah, that’s amazing. Wait, so who nominated you? How did you hear about this?

(Nigel)

Yeah, so I went to an all-boys private school called Gilman in Baltimore, Maryland. And my college adviser was the one who notified me that the school nominated me for the program. I believe they nominated me and maybe one or two others. I’m not exactly sure. But they told me about the program, told me that it was a really great opportunity. There was a senior who was a mentor to me when I was a freshman in high school who was a finalist. He didn’t actually get the scholarship; he was a finalist. And I remember speaking to him about it as well and learning about all the things that he went through when he was a finalist and his Finalist Weekend and all that. So it was really through my college advisor where I learned about it and took off from there.

(Allyson)

Yeah, that’s amazing. How was his experience and advice compared to what you actually went through? Because I’m assuming he did in-person \[Finalist Weekend\] before COVID.

(Nigel)

Yeah, he had an in-person finalist experience, and most of his advice was around interviewing, and that was the most nerve-wracking part of it, especially because he had in-person interviews. It was a little bit different because for my interview, I was in my room, on Zoom with a panel of, I think, maybe four or five people. It didn’t exactly match up one-to-one, but his excitement, and he was really impressed by the program and really wanted it. He ended up doing great things and went to UPenn and is in a great place now, but he really spoke very highly of the program and his experience as a finalist. And he was also, as I said, my mentor in high school, but was also a captain of the track team and student bodypresident, all these things. So, he was someone I really looked up to. And so, his recommendation that I really take it seriously and try to go for it was huge for me at the time.

(Allyson)

Yeah, that’s amazing. And so, I know I did mine virtually. Were you able to come on campus before you came to school, or how was that situation?

(Nigel)

Yeah, so I did not step foot on campus until after I knew that I had gotten the scholarship. It was in April or May, I want to say, when I finally got it, and my parents wanted me to actually see the campus before making that final decision. And so, we came down, and I’ll never forget, it was an amazing time because there was nobody on campus. It was really odd to be here. But my host, Simon Palmore, was here, and he took me on a bit of a tour around campus, and it was great. And we came by the Foundation as well. And David Greer and Ann Smith were here, and they greeted us. And it was just a really special opportunity. It was a very unique one-on-one time that we got with some of the Foundation staff because no one was here. It was all social distancing, and everyone was in their respective areas. But, yeah, I didn’t actually end up coming to campus until after I knew that I had the scholarship.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And how was that shift when you got to campus? Because you’re out-of-state, and that’s hard.

(Nigel)

Yeah, it was hard. And I remember at the time thinking about coming to the South. I had lived in San Antonio, Texas, for a little bit before high school in elementary school. So, I had a little bit of experience with the South, but nothing that I could really relate to and no family in North Carolina or anything like that. And so, it was an adjustment, for sure. But I think the connections that I was able to make during my virtual Finalist Weekend really pulled me through. My freshman year, five out of the eight guys that I lived with in E-House were all Morehead guys in my class. And so that really was a huge part of my integration into the Carolina community and just feeling more comfortable coming in freshman year. I know a lot of other out-of-state students don’t necessarily have that community to lean on. And so, it was really great for me to have that and to really have a group of people that I could go to for questions about which building is where and where are the good places to eat and things like that. I could lean on the people that were from here, but also my host and other upperclassmen that had poured into me in the whole finalist process.

(Allyson)

Wait, so when you got to campus, were you all wearing masks? That was 2021, right?

(Nigel)

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Masks were required, I want to say, for the first semester. And I think the second semester, they were optional. But I remember actually the second semester was when I got COVID, that was the first time. And it was not a great time. But, yeah, freshman year was fully… everyone was masked in classes. It feels so distant now, but, yeah, that was a huge part of freshman year.

(Allyson)

How was that, joining clubs and stuff? I feel like you’re just so separated from the whole community.

(Nigel)

Yeah, I want to say that there weren’t really that many big gatherings. Organizations weren’t doing any huge public events. And obviously, at the time, everyone was very comfortable with Zoom, that format. So, some of the things that I was a part of freshman year were all virtual really. Even though we were in the same physical location spread across campus, it was mostly on Zoom, which was interesting. I think, as I said, people were comfortable with it at that time, but it was also quite meaningful to increase the accessibility of the different kinds of people you’re able to meet. So, for example, there was a program called Real Talk for Black men, and it was a group to meet twice a month to talk about your mental health and really was a huge part of me acclimating to Carolina and getting to know some of the guys here. But then once things started getting more relaxed with COVID restrictions, we had in-person meetings as well. And so that was just a great part of my freshman year, where a lot of those guys I didn’t actually see in person too often because things were on Zoom, and everyone was comfortable with that, it was still a really impactful part of my freshman year.

(Allyson)

I love that. And I know you were an Agora fellow. It’s really funny because I’m one now. And I remember looking back on the website, I was like, “Okay, Nigel.” I just saw you immediately. And I always thought that was so cool. But tell me a little bit about the Agora Fellowship and why you joined?

(Nigel)

Sure. The Agora Fellowship was my junior year when I did that. So, it was a little bit forward in the college process. But I believe I was in the second or third cohort of Agora Fellows. It is a program through the Program for Public Discourse. And we essentially learn how to facilitate conversation, civic dialogue. Or it goes by a bunch of different names. But we learn ways to foster conversations among students. And it’s typically around issues that are maybe more controversial or difficult to have conversations about. But in my experience, it was really an opportunity to practice that skill. I don’t think that people think about facilitating dialogue or having a conversation as something to practice just because we do it naturally all the time. But this was an opportunity to be really intentional about how we are constructing conversations on campus. What are the goals and aspirations that we have with those conversations? What are the most equitable ways to do that? How can we actually bring people into conversations that are more difficult? But again, just exercising that skill of how to have a real productive conversation. That’s what drew me to the Agora Fellowship. And I think it was a great opportunity when I was in the cohort to, at the very least, meet new people and have a really interesting conversation about their worldview.

(Allyson)

And also to put you on the spot, do you remember your favorite conversation or most impactful conversation in the Fellowship?

(Nigel)

I’m not sure I remember one in particular, but there were certainly opportunities to take what we learned and share that with the community. So, I remember we had a conversation about either diversity or affirmative action, something along those lines, and we invited the campus, so we invited students to come participate. And I was facilitating one of those conversations, and it was just a great dialogue with a bunch of different people from different parts of campus. And I remember it was outside of Phillips \[Hall\]. We set up chairs outside that area of campus. And it was really rewarding because it was a time to take what we had been learning. And you know Kevin Marinelli, the director of the program, had been pouring into us and emphasizing all these different things for so long. And so, we finally got to put it into practice. And so that was a great opportunity for me. And it motivated me to try to do more of that, to take the things that we were learning and apply that to not only structured conversations like that, but every aspect of the other things that I was involved in.

(Allyson)

I feel like one word, in my perception of you, one word to describe, actually two words, is public discourse. I feel like everything you do is somehow revolving around public discourse in a way, in the best way possible. Food for Thought, which is an initiative you created as a sophomore from your Civic Collaboration summer, that is hosted every Friday and brings in speakers. Tell me more about that. I’m on the new Food for Thought team, and I’m always astonished by the original team.

(Nigel)

Yeah, I know. And you all are killing it. I’m glad that you all can carry the torch. But yeah, as you said, this was an idea we had. Tucker Stoneman actually was who really spearheaded the idea and wanted the Cleveland team to be the team that brought this to life. So, the original group was Tucker, me, Kate Quadland, and Kendall Lee. And we just worked so well together before in our Civic Collaboration in Cleveland and wanted to continue that and to bring back some of the things that we had learned there and brought the model to the \[Food for Thought\] program. I was actually abroad when they were first pitching the idea to Chris and others in the Foundation. But when I came back in the second semester of my sophomore year was when we first had our first couple of speakers. And it was, I think, a hit from the beginning.

We tried to get as many different kinds of speakers to touch on a lot of different kinds of topics. And sometimes they’re more political, sometimes they’re more educational, sometimes they’re more about the arts or sports. But I’ll never forget our first speaker, Dr. Hickox, he’s an astrophysicist who specializes in black holes. And it was a topic that I had just never even considered. I’m not in STEM at all, and so, it was really outside of my area of expertise. But it really, I think, encapsulated what it was all about, where we had a real expert in the field come and provide a really interesting take on modern science and space exploration and what it takes to do that and his academic perspective on that. And then being able to ask that person any question you want is the idea behind Food for Thought. I’ve been really proud of the work we’ve been able to do and carry it on. And I’m really glad that y’all are continuing it.

(Allyson)

I genuinely did not know how much went into it. It’s insane. Setting out all the tables, doing the silverware, literally catering essentially, and then recruiting the speaker, and then making sure their accommodations are all good. It’s a lot. How did you balance, I guess this is just me asking on a personal level, how did you balance all of that?

(Nigel)

No, it is a lot. I think it really, why it worked was in large part because our team was really close to begin with. From the beginning, we didn’t know each other going into Civic Collaboration. I think we had talked before and met each other and been in some of the similar circles but not on that level. We had not worked together in that way. And so, because we knew we worked so well together over the summer, we were able to apply that same dynamic to Food for Thought. And I think it worked quite well. Everyone took on different roles quite naturally, I think. I don’t really think that there was a point where in the group there was one real leader that was directing everybody. We all worked quite collaboratively to come up with the concept and to adapt it to the Foundation and to bring it to life. I think it just was a product of how well we work together.

(Allyson)

It’s seriously so amazing how student-led it is. I think that’s so phenomenal about Food for Thought. And I’m just so happy to be part of the new team coming in. I don’t know, even hosting it today, very stressful, at the same time, it’s so rewarding to have all those little skills, like I know where to put a fork on the table and things like that. But speaking of student roles, tell me about your work in student government. Actually, first, what does student government do?

(Nigel)

Great, great question. My introduction to student government was my junior year. So, I guess in the life of someone who’s in student government, I was a little bit late to the program there. But I started off as a Deputy Chief of Staff. And the roles, there are a lot of different roles, and there are a lot of different offices and departments and things. It can get a little bit confusing. But I’ll say when it comes down to it, the description of what student government does is really to represent and advocate for the student body. And that is easier said than done for sure. Because we’re on a campus with 32,000 students. The executive branch is really focused on undergraduates, and the graduate students have their own form of student government. But in my role now as the Chief of Staff, so I took one step up from last year, I work very closely with the Student Body President who represents all 32,000 students. And so, we have to take all of those experiences and concerns and opinions and translate that or massage that into something that administrators and faculty members and staff will understand and resonate with and apply.

And again, easier said than done, especially on a campus with a massive campus of students, but also so many different departments and so many different administrators with different personalities and different interests. And so, there’s a lot of different ways that we do that work. There’s the cabinet that I run, a secondary title for Chief of Staff is Chief of the Cabinet now, which is made up of seven different departments led by different students that focus on different areas of campus, if it’s DEI or environmental affairs or academic affairs or civic engagement, there’s something for everything. And that is our most diverse group within the executive branch. But then there’s the Student Senate as well. They’re the ones that allocate funding to all the different student organizations. And then there’s the executive council offices. So, my office, the Office of the Chief of Staff. But then there’s the President’s office, the Vice President’s office. You can get granular with it. There are over 100 people that are involved in student government. But it’s this big group of people who are really focused on and passionate about representing the best interests of students. And so, we try to do that to the best of our ability.

(Allyson)

Yeah, that’s amazing. There’s the student body president election going on right now. And you’re seeing the posts everywhere. But it’s like, what does the student body president even do? And that was always a question. But I don’t know. I know you all do stuff, but now you’re explaining it fully. I get it now.

(Nigel)

Yeah, and I should add, the role of the student body president is unique. I mean, they sit on the Board of Trustees. And so that is the ultimate advocacy role of a student. And then the rest of the executive branch is really focused on implementing the policy that they run on and then the programming that complements that policy. So, for example, something that the current student body president, Jaleah Taylor, ran on was a huge Get Out the Vote campaign because we knew that we were going to be in an election year. And so, the Department of Civic Engagement Outreach Services, run by Nick \[Hamilton\] and Zoe \[Sinclair\], who are students on campus right now, really took that on and put out what I thought was a really great effort. It was a campus-wide effort and partnered with a lot of different organizations and different parts of student government, as well, but she really took that aspect of her platform and brought it to life in a way that I was really proud of. And so that’s just one example of the kinds of things that we do.

(Allyson)

I just saw another initiative. Was it… It’s like the dining hall swipes?

(Nigel)

Yeah, that’s right. It’s another huge one for the executive branch and something that Julia ran on. She’s been working, really since she ran last year, to get this program here at Carolina. It’s a program that we’ve seen at other campuses in the UNC system, where you can donate meal swipes to students in need, trying to really get at the problem of food insecurity on campus, especially in places like South campus, where there are limited options for food. And part of the effort to get that program started was to provide the evidence \[of need\] to the Board of Trustees. And the way that she did that was a campus-wide effort to get first-hand feedback on how students are experiencing food security and what that actually means for their day-to-day life, and how a program like this would actually help that aspect of their student experience. And huge win, I think, for student government and for Jaleah. She’s put so much time and effort into bringing that to life. And I think it’s just a testament to the work that we’re really trying to strive to do and the impact we’re trying to have. And ultimately, she’s a senior, I’m a senior. It’s something great that I think we can leave the university with.

(Allyson)

And you were talking about DEI earlier. So how is that change with policies and so forth coming down from both UNC administration as well as Washington?

(Nigel)

Yeah. Well, now things are changing on a national level. I think we’ve seen the trend against DEI in a lot of different states, but now it’s a coordinated national effort, considering the executive orders that have been passed. Prior to that, though, as you know, in the summer, the UNC system repealed and replaced their DEI policy. And so that certainly meant changes on the administrative level. But very specifically in the new policy, student organizations are exempt from that repeal. And so, we were able to still have a Department of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, which was central to Jaleah’s campaign. And it is difficult, I’m sure, as you can imagine, when you run on something that is so core to your campaign and core to your values, and then the university goes in a complete opposite way. And so, it’s been a challenge for sure to deal with that and try to find ways to still bring the essence of what the words actually mean, diversity and equity and inclusion, separate that from how politicized it has become and really bring the substance.

But one thing that I’m proud of in terms of the transition in policy that the DEI Department put on was a Q&A with our former Chief Diversity Officer, Leah Cox. She came and did a town hall, and it was great turnout with students who were troubled by the change, really wanting to get some answers for what a Carolina without DEI would look like. And I thought it was a great opportunity for them to learn more about, I guess, the specifics of what that policy change means. And hopefully, we can do something similar now that this executive order has passed, and now we’ve gotten the memo from the Board of Governors as well to now make DEI-focused classes not required for your gen eds or for your major. So, there’s a lot of change. I think this student government administration has seen a lot of change at Carolina. Thinking about things like major protests on campus but also doing away with the student honor court system. There’s been a lot of different major shifts in Carolina culture and the structure of Carolina that we’ve had to deal with. But like I said, we do it to the best of our ability.

(Allyson)

Yeah. And speaking of advocacy, what is your take on protests in general? What do you think? You’re all about public discourse. At least to me, what do you think is the best way to go about advocating or speaking upon a problem or issue or so forth?

(Nigel)

Yeah, this is an issue that I think about a lot, especially as an Agora fellow, and especially considering the development of the new School for Civic Life and Leadership, which is all about civic discourse. Well, I guess a short story. I did a Lovelace Fund for Discovery with my good friend, Willow, who also actually happened to do my Outward Bound with me before I came to Carolina. But she was an Agora Fellow as well. And we were both really trying to get at the idea of what is civic discourse? Why is it something that is so valuable? And so, we did a tour last spring break of three different universities. We were at Princeton, Arizona State University, and Stanford, looking at their equivalents to the School for Civic Life and Leadership, with the goal of coming back with some key reflections on what that looks like on campus and how that’s been implemented in other universities.

And I think my big takeaway from that experience and from all my experience with the Agora Fellowship and the Program for Public Discourse is a real sense that civic discourse, what is viewed as a civic discourse and described as civic discourse, cannot be juxtaposed with protest, with activism. I think that it’s a mistake for us to set those two things as a binary choice that we have to make as an institution, as an individual. I think they quite seriously go hand-in-hand when trying to create change. I have good relationships with people who protest far more than I do. I also have good relationships with people who think that protest is not effective or not the way to create change. I fall somewhere in between, where I think they both have to happen at the same time. Some people are more inclined to protest and have a more activist calling, which I think is great, and I think is an essential part of change at Carolina and has been for decades. And some people are more inclined to articulate their ideas in a way that is more acknowledged by an institution, more institutionally supported. And I think over the past year, we’ve had such major protests that have mirrored past movements. And it’s been really inspiring to see. It’s been really great to have. Sometimes if you want to have discourse, you’ve got to have something to talk about. And so, the protest, in some ways, gives you the thing to talk about. It draws the attention. It is the thing that puts a spotlight on an issue. And I think that the civic discourse can pair with that so well when it is done thoughtfully and with consideration to the issues.

I think a mistake that we’ve made at Carolina is sometimes focusing too much on the way in which people talk about an issue or the way in which people try to get change and less about the actual content, the actual issue at hand. And so, I’ve been going back and forth with a lot of my friends and administrators and colleagues in student government about how to mesh those two things and do both in a way that is effective, because I do think real change doesn’t come with just one or the other.

(Allyson)

I love that. I feel like I just got so many power quotes just from listening to you. That’s amazing. And you’re a philosophy major, or you’re in that realm?

(Nigel)

I am a PPE minor, so I take some philosophy classes. But my major is Management and Society through the Sociology Department. So, I started off in Sociology and transitioned to Management and Society, I think in my sophomore year. But then I’m also a history minor.

(Allyson)

Oh, that’s so cool. I didn’t know that. Because I feel like I don’t know. I saw that you had done a philosophy talk sponsored by the philosophy department. And I think it was civic discourse.

(Nigel)

It was civic discourse related. It was like that. My junior year, most of my life was civic discourse. So, this was a fellowship called the Balter Fellowship, through the Philosophy Department, where they invite students to explore. They fund you as well to explore a philosophical question, trying to encourage diversity within the different things that we are pursuing in philosophy. And my idea was to examine the morality of civic discourse, which is an ambiguous topic, but really thinking about when we are advocating for civic discourse, who does that burden fall on when we want students to engage with people with differing opinions or people from the other side of an issue. Really trying to get at what is the power imbalance that that might create? What role does emotion have in civic discourse? How does, as I was saying earlier, civic discourse juxtapose with protests and other forms of civic expression? So that was a great opportunity. That was honestly one of the things I’m more proud of in my time at Carolina. I gave a lecture, and that was the culminating project of that fellowship. But it was great. Kevin Marinelli came, and some other Agora Fellows came to support me. And we had a really great conversation about what it means to do civic discourse well.

(Allyson)

Yeah. I think it’s so funny because I had told you this earlier, but somebody had mentioned in the Agora meeting your exact talk, and it was a year ago. So that just shows how profound it was to at least one person. I think that just shows how impactful that was. And he was genuinely so passionate. He was really excited. He name-dropped you. And I was like, “I know Nigel.”

(Nigel)

That’s really great. That is heartwarming.

(Allyson)

But tell me about your future plans. I know that’s a scary question.

(Nigel)

Yeah, it is a scary question. It’s a question that I’m sure seniors are tired of at this point, we hear a lot of that. But I think for me, I’ve really settled on the idea that public service is going to be the next step for me. I know, ultimately, I want to go back to school, either for law school or the public policy program or something of that nature. But at least right after Carolina, I want to go into public service and work for a year or two. This summer, I was an intern through the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. So, I was working in Hakeem Jeffrey’s leadership office, which was just an amazing opportunity. It was something that, I got the internship quite late in the planning for the Professional Development Summer process, but I really, really loved my time there. I fell in love with D.C. as a city, but I also fell in love with Capitol Hill and the energy that was brought there, and the real sense that what you’re doing there is making a difference or it feels important, at least. And so, I know that D.C. is an option for me, hopefully trying to get back on Capitol Hill.

But as I said earlier, I’m from Maryland, and so working for a Maryland representative is really the goal. But still applying for things like government jobs is a little bit slow in relation to other jobs in other sectors. But I’m still applying for things and waiting for my time to come when I finally know what I’ll be doing.

(Allyson)

That’s so exciting. And to start closing our episode, I wanted to do a rapid-fire session. Happy Friday, okay. That was the surprise I had. I’m trying to remember the questions. I think the first one was what book are you currently reading or what book would you recommend people to read?

(Nigel)

Yeah, I have two books that I will say. One is a… it’s not actually a book. I think it was turned into a book, but it was a commencement speech by David Foster Wallace. And we read this speech in a philosophy class I had, I think my sophomore year, freshman year, maybe. But I’ve revisited it so many times, and it’s really shaped the way that I try to approach interacting with other people and going through my day-to-day life. It’s called This is Water. I highly recommend giving that a read, reading it yourself, but also listening to David Foster Wallace deliver the speech. Really great message that he has to give there. The second book is a book that was recommended to me. One of my friends who graduated last year was giving other people gifts as she was leaving, and so, she gave me this book called Babel. I think the secondary title is The Necessity for Violence or something along those lines. And I am blanking on the author of that book, but it is a really, really interesting book that is historical fiction that concerns protest and activism and revolution in a college setting. So, at the time that I was reading it over the summer, it resonated very much with some of the things that I was experiencing with protests on campus, but really just a thought-provoking and well-designed book. It’s quite long, but I really, really loved that book. It’s definitely one of my most recent favorites.

(Allyson)

That’s amazing. Okay, so the second question that we have is, what is the theme song of your life?

(Nigel)

The theme song of my life is really hard. I think it would have to be something Stevie Wonder, something off of Songs in the Key of Life. The whole album, maybe, I’ll say. I think one of the best albums ever created. And so it just has a really familiar feel to me. It reminds me of my family, reminds me of my roots and time with my family, which is really, for me, at the end of the day, all that really matters and what I always come back to. So Songs in the Key of Life, best album, I think.

(Allyson)

That’s amazing. Our third question, I’m trying to think. Do you remember? Who’s the most influential person in your life?

(Nigel)

Yeah, definitely my parents, definitely my parents. I feel like most people that we ask that question, that’s who it is. But they have just poured so much into me to be the person that I am today, instilled in me a sense of self-confidence and purpose and responsibility. Both of my parents really just poured so much into me. My mom actually homeschooled my brothers and me for elementary school. And so it literally was her job to educate us as we were younger. They’re just really great, great parts of my life that have always been there to support me.

(Allyson)

Yeah. Our last question is, what would you do with a billion dollars?

(Nigel)

With a billion dollars? That is a lot of money. I think I would certainly pour it into the education system, particularly the public education system in Baltimore. I was incredibly privileged to experience a private education in Baltimore city, technically, but not anywhere near the kind of Baltimore city that people imagine when you say that. And the public school system there is in such need. And ultimately, I think as I go into public service, education is at the core of some of the things that I’d like to try to make an impact on. So I definitely would pour the money into the public school system in Baltimore.

(Allyson)

Well, thank you, Nigel. That was amazing. It was great to have you on today. And with that, that concludes Kickin’ It in the Kitchen.

(Nigel)

That’s it.

(Allyson)

That was awesome. I feel like I learned so much about you.

Episode Transcription

(Stella)

Brad, thank you so much for being here today. (Brad)

Pleasure.

(Stella)

You began your term this January. How have your first couple of months in office been, and has anything surprised you?

(Brad)

Sure. Thanks for having me. It’s really a pleasure to be here. I walk past the Foundation with some regularity, but I don’toften come in, so it’s a pleasure to be in the Foundation. I started January 1, so I don’t know why we swear people in onJanuary 1 in the state of North Carolina, but we do. It makes for tough holiday vacations. I’m about day 60 or so into office. I think when you run for office, you have a great sense for the big things that you’ll face. It’s the little things that sneak up on you. Whether those are incremental responsibilities or small pieces of the job that happen to require a lot of attention, those have been the surprises. The one big one is that the treasurer’s department has not historically been involved in lending, and they asked us to get involved in helping with some lending out in the western part of the state in recovery from Helene. That has been a big effort that I had no idea I was going to get myself into, in part because it didn’tpass into law until December, well after I ran for office.

(Stella)

What were your thoughts on campaigning for public office? What was that process like before even January? I’m sure that started way before.

(Brad)

Way before. So, the filing deadline was December 15, 2023. I was at it for almost eleven months. I think people forget, A, how big this state is, and B, how diverse this state is. No matter where you live, you spend a lot of time there, and you may not get to other counties, towns, and big cities if it’s the inverse. So, you’re reminded of that over and over again. One. Two, I think people who are not overly politically involved or deeply cynical about politics, and there are some good reasons for that, are, in fact, coming from a good place. They really want to see this country get better. I obviously ran as a Republican. I suspect that’s true on the Democratic side, too. I can’t imagine it’s not. You’re reminded of that every time you interact with people that there’s an earnest belief in the power and promise of this country, and it’s really refreshing.

(Stella)

I love that. I think it would be great to start from the beginning of your journey and work our way up to your current position. Starting with your time at Carolina, even before Carolina, actually, you’re originally from Dallas. Why choose Carolina?

(Brad)

Sure. Sure. I went from Dallas to boarding school in New Hampshire. I had considered Duke and UNC as a senior in high school. I was honestly not very impressed with UNC when I first was here. I had a terrible tour guide who, with a group full of out-of-state students, was insistent on describing in detail how she’d never left the state of North Carolina and never wanted to. That was not a great first impression, but it obviously got better from there. I was invited to Finals Weekend through the automatic nomination at that time through my school in New Hampshire and fell in love with the place. It helped that it was February, and down here, it was like today: sunny and beautiful. It probably is in New Hampshire today, but it was snowing sideways in the twenties. That was a not insignificant factor, but there are, of course, many others. Coming here was a natural halfway home, but not all the way. Then everything grew from there. From undergrad at UNC, I went to work for UNC. Managing their money was what put me on the path today.

(Stella)

I love that. More about your time as a Morehead-Cain Scholar. You said that managing UNC’s money put you on the path you are today. Is there anything from your time as a scholar that shaped your perspective on public service or maybe ledto the position, you’re in today?

(Brad)

Sure. The summer programs the Foundation provided at the time, and I suspect still does, were really foundational in why I chose the Morehead Scholarship in the first place. Excuse me, Morehead-Cain, I’m a little older. Still have never quite gotten that right. And for me, working at Goldman Sachs was a big one. I spent the summer of 1997 there. For those who study financial history, the summer of 1997 was fairly eventful with the Asian financial crisis and some other things that went on there. I knew from the get-go that I wanted to be in finance and investments. So that’s not really what I learned at Goldman. What I learned there is all the different ways to be involved and all the detail behind where you want to go and why in your career. The other story I’ll tell from that summer, which actually has a big bearing on why I ran for office in the first place, is we were at the office late one night, and this was the very early days of the internet, so news wasn’t exactly real-time at that time. We got a notification that there had been a plane crash. I was sitting with the airline analyst and his analyst, and he mentioned that the first thing that crossed his mind when he heard there was a plane crash was to ask who the manufacturer of the plane was.

Not how many people died, not where, but really what company was going to be affected by it. And that was and is pretty disturbing when you think about it. We all have skills that we’re blessed with, and you have to ask yourself the question, how are you using them? And that was the first moment that I thought, “Well, maybe he’s not using his skills exactly right.” If that’s the first thing he thinks about, humanity as well, which company’s stock is going to be down tomorrow?

(Stella)

And what summer was that? What year was that between?

(Brad)

That was between sophomore and junior year.

(Stella)

Got it.

(Brad)

Then after your time at Carolina, you must have loved it a lot, since that first bad tour, and you chose to work on UNC’s Board of Trustees. What do you feel like you accomplished on that board?

(Brad)

I joked that I was there for a cup of coffee. So, not a lot, honestly. I was there for fourteen months. So, it was a very shorttenure. There are a number of trustees, there are fifteen. I think that I did have my fingerprints on some things, but in the end, it is a group of fifteen who need to act together. During that tenure, we did have a chancellor change, a chancellor search. So that was the most consequential thing that happened during that period of time. There were other endeavors that had been put in place in advance of my joining the board of trustees, including the School of Civic Life and Leadership, which I think is an important contribution to Carolina and how it’s evolving. Those were the two big things, but it was a very short period of time. One of my biggest regrets of running for office is that I can’t continually serve on the board of trustees as a result.

(Stella)

And then currently, in the student body now, the board of trustees is a little bit controversial, especially with our current political climate. What do you hope to convey to students about the purpose of the board and its impact on Carolina and why is it really important?

(Brad)

I suspect the board of trustees is, was, and always will be controversial for the students. That’s not new. When I was an undergrad, there were protests with the board of trustees around tuition increases. I suspect the political affiliations were different at that time. It is a governing board, and governing boards have to make decisions that will not uniformly be popular. That is not new. The board of trustees has evolved a little bit, in part, in its relationship to the board of governors in our system, and I don’t think that’s particularly well understood. The vast majority of power in the UNC system sits with the board of governors. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is run by the chancellor. The board oftrustees s has certain powers to approve who the Chancellor is and some other actions of it. But what you find yourself as a board of trustees member is often caught between the board of governors, who has most of the power, and the Chancellor, who runs the school. You are much more an advisory board than you are a governing board, which is frustrating at times. What I’d ask people to hear from that is that the board of trustees has the institution’s best interests in mind, but the number of levers of power that it actually has are very few.

(Stella)

Is there a time when you experienced that frustration on the board? Or what are the responsibilities, other than advising? What are some things the trustees would advise on, or you advised on when you were on the board?

(Brad)

So, there’s the business operations in the university, and for me, that’s very much in my wheelhouse. So, I got involved in that in a reasonably deep way, and the finances in the university and how we run it. But that, again, much more as an advisor. We have a wonderful CFO here at the university, which I suspect ten students in total could even name. That’s the nature of things in the business operations of the university. So, getting involved in that and thinking about our long-term plan for how revenue is brought in, the mix of that revenue, and the expenses associated with that, those are interesting topics to me. And so, I was able to get a bit involved in those, but I recognize those are probably not for everybody.

(Stella)

Well, you’ve talked a lot about your interest in finance and how you are drawn to those opportunities with finance. And you said you already knew you wanted to work in finance before going to Goldman Sachs. When was that moment in your life when you decided to work in finance? Or what sparked that interest? Because I agree, that’s not something that most people think they want to work in.

(Brad)

No, it’s not. I joke that I’m the world’s worst business school speaker because you’re always asked for career advice and how you developed your interest in whatever you ended up in. And usually, people have a great story. I don’t. I’ve literallyalways been interested in this. So, the moment that it really was poignant for me was when I was 10 years old and the stock market had crashed. My dad was an investor at the time. He had lost his job before that, and so it was a nice comeback story, but not that day. My mom picked us up from school. She worked at the school and said, “Hey, we’re not going home for dinner. We’re going out to dinner.” We never went out for dinner. That’s when I knew something was wrong. She educated us at the time, the market crashed, and here’s what that means, and here’s why your dad is mad, and all those things. To me, it made it powerful and poignant in a familial sense—this matters to people. It’s not just numbers on a screen. I always was interested in math, but then I really understood how important finance is to everybody’s life, and I’ve never lost that interest.

(Stella)

Very cool. I love that. You do have a story. Technically, you do have a story.

(Brad)

It’s not very good advice, though.

(Stella)

No, it’s great. Did that story contribute to why you wanted to run for treasurer, or is there another reason?

(Brad)

When you are blessed in life, you develop choices. Over time, that happened to me. The old adage about needing to feedyour family becomes a little less true. I think others in my age group are well past that conversation. Then it becomes about, are you satisfied with who you’re working with and for? At a moment, at the end of 2021, I was running an organization of over 100 people and many billions of dollars under management. We had a great year. I went in to see the guy I was working for, and I needed him to tell me so I could pass it on to my team. I said, “Hey, here’s how much money we made for you this year. Here’s how that compares to other people.” And he looks at me sincerely and says, “What am I going to do with all that money?” It was the wrong response in that it started me down a path of thinking, “Well, what is he going to do with all that money? And does it matter? Does it matter to him? And is the work I’m doing important to even the person I work for, let alone the world?”

(Brad)

And that led me down the path towards really seriously considering running for treasurer. It’s something I’ve always been fascinated with, back to the finance interest. So, it was a natural blending of those two things over time.

(Stella)

That makes sense. I think that insight of “Am I satisfied with what I’m doing?” is not something that a lot of people would think. I think a lot of people would feel like they’re feeding their family in a really stable job and maybe not have that thought across their mind. I tend to see that more with Morehead-Cain Scholars, that thought of, “Oh, am I satisfied? Am I doing something for the greater good?” Is there any something that you could point to of why you think you have that leadership quality?

(Brad)

I think it all begins with knowing you’re blessed. I think many times people aren’t always conscious of the blessings they’ve received and how they’ve received them. It begins there, of saying, “I don’t deserve everything I have.” I was blessed in many ways by my parents, by the Morehead-Cain Scholarship, by many other things. A debt is how I wake up in the morning thinking every day. And then it becomes, can you pay that debt? And how? So, for me, the skills that I love to employ happen to be valuable to the state. And the nice, harmonious matching of those two things is what led me on a path that I think makes sense for me. Making that advice that’s more broad is hard because it is always facts and circumstances dictated. First, you have to be able to step back and have the capacity financially to do that and say, “I want to sacrifice.” Then you’ve got to find something that is worth making that sacrifice for. I think you get to a really great place for public service in the long run.

(Stella)

I love that. Thank you so much for sharing. Sure. Moving into your day-to-day role now as the North Carolina Treasurer. I actually had to look up exactly what the role was. Just to tell listeners what your responsibilities include, I see that you manage and distribute state funds, invest and manage the state’s pension fund, manage and select the health plan for the employees, provide financial support to local governments, manage unclaimed property, and even more. And that sounds like a lot of responsibilities. So, what would you say is your typical day in office?

(Brad)

Well, that’s one of the things I love about it, is there’s no really such thing. I’ve got six, so these are seven different core responsibilities, and so every day, one of those takes up more time than others for different reasons. In the end, the common theme is this: For those who speak accounting, I manage the state’s balance sheet. For those who maybe are less inclined, I’m the financial advisor for the state. So, we’re not the accountant. We don’t collect the revenue. We don’t set income tax policy. But the assets of the state and the debts of the state,that’s what we do.

So, we touch a number of different areas as you think about that. We manage in total just a little shy of a quarter trillion dollars. I am well aware and conscious every day I walk in the office how many great people work at the Department of State Treasurer. There’s 463 of us. It might be a plus or minus one. It’s a lot of people. So, we move around. And they’reall specialists in different things, different parts of the list you just articulated. Everything from the small, unclaimed property, which is a couple of billion dollars. Any time you’ve left a deposit with a company, it gets turned over to us eventually. I encourage anyone listening to go to nccash.com. It’s a little bit of a commercial, but we probably have some of your money. We’d love to send it back to you. To the big, which is the state pension fund. It’s $130 billion. So, managing large pools of capital like that is what I’vealways done in my career. So that’s the most comfortable responsibility for me of all those. And the most challenging one is we’re a self-insured health insurance company as well for 760,000 state employees and their beneficiaries. So that’s a lot of people. There’s just about 11 million in the state. So, we manage money for a lot of them, and in a really importantway that affects their lives.

(Stella)

Is there one specific issue that you’re particularly passionate about addressing in your tenure?

(Brad)

The one issue that, if we can solve, unlocks so many other solutions is the investment performance of the state. On our $130 billion, we are ranked forty-ninth or fiftieth out of the states in investment performance over medium- and long-term periods. And for me, that is a huge challenge that has real benefit for our state. That’s one-to-two-percent-a-year difference, times $130 billion every year. Our total state budget is $30 billion. So, if we do our job right, we should have another one and a half billion or so that we don’t need from the state budget. Imagine the difference we can make with a billion and a half a year out of state coffers. It doesn’t matter your political affiliation, I think you’d find a good use for that. No matter the farthest left, the farthest right, that’s the General Assembly’s prerogative. I’m just trying to get that money back to the state. That is a big focus. We’ve got a big legislative push to change some things about statutorily how we govern it, which is probably a little more dry than this podcast calls for. But that’s something I’m very passionate about, and I’ve spent a lot of time trying to socialize in front of the legislature already.

(Stella)

Well, that sounds pretty amazing, to increase the money by that much. Is there a reason that we are the 49th or 50th? What are the barriers to being able to do that? It seems like someone of any political affiliation would want to increase our state budget and allow that.

(Brad)

Sure. As with any higher return, there’s high risk. And that’s the conversation, what’s the appropriate level of risk? Most people think of pensions as reasonably short-duration assets. And by that, I mean we need all the money tomorrow to pay our pensioners because they’re older and they need it. That’s not really how pensions work. Pensions are some of the longest-lived creatures around. So, I always tell the story: the Civil War era pension closed in 1865 to new members. The last check out of that pension system was sent in 2021.

(Stella)

Wow.

(Brad)

It takes 100-plus years to close a pension plan. If you wanted to close it. We do not want to do that. ur pension plan is open to new members, and we think it’s a really valuable benefit. So, these things exist for a very long time. And that means you need to invest the assets across a long-time scale. We have been taking a short-term approach. We have been scared of market drawdowns. We’ve been scared of risk. We have been sitting on a lot of cash. We need to make 6.5 percent. To make 6.5 percent, to make the math work for our retirees and our state employees, we have been making five. And that is all the difference in the world.

(Stella)

That makes a lot of sense, even to someone who doesn’t understand finance. So, thank you for explaining that. Sure. So, you just talked about something that North Carolina is maybe ranked below a lot of other states in. What are some innovative North Carolina financial policies or initiatives that other states are seeking to replicate?

(Brad)

Sure. So unclaimed property is top of the list. We do a fantastic job of this. It is rather esoteric, but it is important. What happens when you leave property in a safe deposit box, which people your age probably don’t even know what that is. But in the bank, you could have your own little safe. And if you leave it there and you stop paying, ultimately the bank needs to open that. So, they drill it, they take the property out, they try to find you. If they can’t find you, what happens? Well, it ends up with us. We’ve got a full automated solution. Literally, if you go to nccash.com, you type in your name like any commercial website, it’ll search it in a fraction of a second. It’ll automate a claim for you right thereafter unless it’s too big and then we’ve got to get involved. If it’s ten bucks, we don’t worry about it too much, but if it’s a lot more than that, we do. So that is a tech-enabled and tech-forward solution to a data problem. Many of government’s problems, at least in the Treasury Department, are data problems.

(Brad)

And so how do you use modern technology and modern data processing and even artificial intelligence in the context of government? That is a really tough question, but one that we are beginning to walk down the road of. In unclaimed property, we’ve started that process from the tech side, at least, and other states have noticed. So, we had folks in Virginia down the other day who are trying to learn from us on the unclaimed property side. We do a really good job there. Thepension side,we’ve got a little bit of work to do on the investments, bt on the administration, we’re probably the most efficient administration of pensions in the country. Again, tech-forward and a team who does a great job there.

(Stella)

Very cool. Everyone needs to go to NC Cash and check if they have some money there. Maybe you have some $10 waiting.

(Brad)

You never know.

(Stella)

And then something that I’m super interested in as a health policy management major is that you get to decide the health plan. What are some of the challenges of deciding the health plan for approximately 760,000 state employees? And how do you make such a big decision?

(Brad)

Yeah. So first of all, there’s a board of eight folks who are fantastic, and they bring different policy expertise to that board. So, we leverage them heavily to answer the last question first. So yes, we cover from a health insurance perspective760,000 folks. We’re the largest private payer in the state, and it is a very complicated plan. We face a reasonably generic set of challenges, though, and that’s that everyone knows health care costs continue to accelerate faster than just about any other cost. There is a much bigger problem in play there that we’ve got to try to solve, probably collectively with other folks. We’ve had a conversation with the Medicaid program here in the state and some of the large employers in the state to see if there’s a way to work jointly on different pieces of that problem. In health care particularly, when you try to squeeze costs in one area, it just balloons in other places. And that’s the problem that is really hard to solve,the conjunctive problem as opposed to the individual problem. So, we’re not at all unique in that. Where we are unique is scale and the fact that we have a balance sheet. So, we can begin down the road of self-sourcing, i.e., building our own solutions for our members if we need to. We can promise volume to providers in exchange for discounts. And so, there’s some basic economic tools we can leverage to help. I don’t know if they fully solve the problem. Our simple challenge is that our costs go up about 5.7 percent a year, and our revenues go up about 3.3 percent a year. And so, if we can figure out a way to close that 2.4 percent difference, we will have done a great job here. There’s no blueprint for this, though. Unlike the investment side, where many other states do the thing that we want to do, unlike most of the other divisions as a Department of State Treasurer, it’s not quite clear how we’ll solve the health care challenge. I’m sure you well know all of this from your studies.

(Stella)

Yeah, definitely. I’m sure. I cannot imagine choosing a health plan for even just myself. Choosing it for 760,000 employeeswould be very hard and difficult and challenging. Yes. Still on the health care side, I wanted to talk about costs, and you already talked about that, which is a huge issue in the U.S. But you’ve also taken a stand on getting weight-loss drugs covered for state employees. Why is that important to you?

(Brad)

So, I tend to think about most of life in investing terms. And I think about health care often that way as well, investing in people’s health. How do we use money now to keep people healthy in the medium and long run? Because in the end, that is, first of all and most importantly, great for them. It also actually has a financial benefit for the plan, too.

So GLP-1s, weight loss medications, weight loss programs even, are an essential tool to solving long-term health costs. Of our 760,000 members, we have something like 325,000 of them who have obesity-related comorbidities, two or more, of heart disease, diabetes, etc. Treating these problems after they’ve occurred is very expensive. Preventing them from occurring is not cheap. The GLP-1s are not cheap. But the math of that makes sense for them and for the state health plan.

The other piece of this is price right now is a problem. Price 24 months from now will not be a problem. In the end, capitalism works. People understand these GLP medications are effective, and so every pharmaceutical company who has money is trying to create their own. So, there are two right now.

There will be, in three years, maybe more. And there are only shots right now. There will be pills in the future. So, innovation continues. Competition continues. The effect of that is price comes down. $1,000-a-month Ozempic, Wegovy. We can cover it at $150 or $200. It’ll get there. I’d like for us to enter into an agreement well before then because the benefits of this for our members start now. But in the end, we got to make the plan solve it, too. The difference between state government and the federal government is we have a requirement to balance our books. We can’t deficit spend, and we won’t.

(Stella)

That makes sense. Let’s also move on to the state pension plan. I don’t know a lot about this, but I saw that it was in a big deficit right now. It could reach about $507 million by 2026. What is your plan to address that deficit?

(Brad) Yeah. So, we have two big deficits in the state. The state pension plan is about $16 billion we owe retirees in total. Your number is an annual number, mine is the total number. Makes sense. And then the state health plan is about $35 billion. So, we talk about just a frame for people. There’s about a $30 billion state budget here, and we have about $3.5 billion in state debt. That sounds great, but we have $50 billion of what are non-debt liabilities, and those are the ones that I need to tackle. That’s why this job ends up being very important for the average taxpayer, and certainly the average state employee.

From a pension plan perspective, it really is about investments and changing the rate-of-return paradigm over time, moving that 5 percent up to something closer to the 6.5 percent, which is what . . . it doesn’t really matter your political affiliation. You can find another state that does it better than us. If you’re right leaning, you’d look to Florida and Texas, and you’re left leaning, you’d look to Washington and Oregon, and it turns out they’re all doing the same thing. We’re not doing that.

(Brad)

So, we’re going to shamelessly borrow from them and follow in their footsteps to help deal with the pension challenges. I think we can absolutely solve those. The state health plan, which is the bigger liability, as I said earlier, we’re going to keep chiseling away at it. We’re going to keep trying new and different things. We will fail at some of those. I think the risk in this one is not trying,whether it’s providing our members different medications early, whether it’s entering into agreements with providers to provide them much more volume in exchange for a lower price. Really, everything’s on the table because, in the end, if you fast forward ten years, the state health plan will either be governed by some market-based competition or some prescriptive price paradigm from the top down. I am a Republican, I am a capitalist, and I strongly prefer the former. But if we cannot make that work, we don’t have a whole lot of time until we’re mandating this from the top down. And that’s bad for everybody, in my opinion.

(Stella)

Right. How do you make sure that retirees, current and future, are going to have long-term financial stability if you’regoing into taking a little bit more risk with that 6.2 percent or 6.5 percent?

(Brad)

Yeah. So, a couple of different pieces of it. The pension as a general instrument is fading away,not for North Carolina, but in the corporate world, people do not offer these things anymore. They are wonderful benefits. And the reason for that is often forgotten in the midst of a bull market. We are, maybe the bull market is over, maybe it’s not,but we are not so far from all-time highs in the stock market, and people’s memories are not that long. Most folks don’t remember 2008 or 2009 at this point. 2020 with COVID was just such a very short blip that it doesn’t really count. And so, people don’t value the promise in a pension plan appropriately, in my view, right now.

The pension payments that we promise to our teachers and our state employees are not just out of the pension fund. They are off the back of the full state’s faith and credit as well. So, you are going to get those payments as long as North Carolina is solvent. And I think that is a really important peace of mind for people who serve our state over a long period of time.

(Brad)

But it also can be very expensive, and that’s why the corporate world has walked away from them. So, to me, the first thing is value the pension appropriately. The second, for those who don’t have that option, is begin early. If you have a 401(k) match, that is the best investment that you can make. They are matching you 50 cents on a dollar or a dollar for every dollar. Take advantage of that because starting early and getting that off-the-bat return is the best investment you can make. And as I believe Einstein once said, compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.

(Stella)

Yeah, I started my,not 401(k),my IRA already. It’s going. All right. Let’s look at this from a general view. You said you are in charge of 400 employees in your office. How have your experiences in the private sector, the public sector, really shaped your overall leadership philosophy? And how does that philosophy influence your approach to addressing these key responsibilities as a state treasurer?

(Brad)

I’ve always believed in hiring great people, giving them the tools to be successful, and getting out of their way. And the last part is actually the hardest part. Great people you can find. Convincing them to work for you, particularly for a state wage, can be a little bit of a trick, but there are many people who are so interested in seeing the state be successful, and in the psychic income that comes from that, that has been actually pretty straightforward.

Getting them the tools to be successful can be a bit of a challenge at times, but in many cases, it’s just giving them the authority to make decisions. Getting out of their way is the hardest part. I have to remind myself every day that I have hired people who have much more expertise than me in a specific area, and I need to let them run that area because as good as I think I might be at whatever they’re doing, they are better. That’s why I hired them. And so, to me, that is the leadership philosophy that has worked. But it is hard. I think investing and running a company,because this is running a company, the emotional challenges, the emotional self-control that’s required to be good at that is the central challenge.

(Brad)

Making sure that it is about the people who do a great job for you and not about you is what’s essential to my leadership style.

(Stella)

I love that. Thank you for sharing. Sure. Then just to finish our episode, why should scholars consider careers in public service? Why should scholars have this thought in the back of their head about, Am I really satisfied with my career, or should I serve the public good?

(Brad)

Listen, I think in the end, we all know that the public discourse has not exactly been what we wanted it to be. Again, that is not a left or right statement. I think we all agree that we’re leaving something, and we need to backfill for it.

As I thought what I’m going to say about going to public service and why to advocate for as many people who are willing and able, because it is a financial sacrifice, and you need to make sure you’re prepared to do that, is that you have to try. We all have to try. It’s not enough to sit on the sideline and complain about it. In whatever way you can, whether it’s your school board or something bigger than that, get involved. Because sitting on the sideline and complaining about the fractiousness of our politics.I understand that’s a safe place. But if everyone makes that choice, then we’re sunk.

I’d advocate for anyone who’s got the stomach for it,and it does require some stomach. The first time you get criticized publicly is not fun, and neither is the second, but it gets a little easier. But we all have to try in our own way, whatever that is.

That’s why I’d advocate it. I get up in the morning and I go to work, and every meeting I have, I realize that the state could use my skills and the skills of everybody who works with me, too. That is true for everyone who’s listening, too.

(Stella)

Thank you so much for sharing that. That is very powerful to a lot of our scholars, and maybe alumni will consider this. Brad, thank you so much for being here today and sharing your stories.

(Brad)

Thanks for inviting me back. I appreciate it.

In this episode, Kristina Chapple ’22 joins scholar host Stella Smolowitz ’26 to share her fast-tracked journey from UNC–Chapel Hill to becoming a general partner at [11 Tribes Ventures](https://11tribes.vc/), an early-stage venture capital firm investing in values-driven founders.

Kristina reflects on how her undergraduate experience at Carolina, including her interdisciplinary coursework, entrepreneurship minor, and time abroad with the UNC Shuford Program in Entrepreneurship, set the foundation for a purpose-led career. A Phi Beta Kappa inductee and Wilberforce Leadership Program alumna, Kristina discusses how community and curiosity continue to shape her approach to leadership.

She offers an inside look at how 11 Tribes Ventures evaluates startups and prioritizes mission alignment and character as much as financial viability. The conversation dives into her belief in challenging conventional VC practices, supporting visionary founders, and leading with empathy in high-stakes environments.

Kristina also shares insights for young professionals on navigating early career decisions, creating meaningful impact, and maintaining integrity—plus, what it was like to be named to the [Forbes 30 Under 30 list in venture capital](https://www.forbes.com/profile/kristina-chapple/).

## Episode transcription

(Stella)

*So, this morning at the Food for Thought session, you shared about walking into a space with a “there you are” mentality instead of a “here I am” mentality, which I think stuck with a lot of scholars that I was talking to afterwards. How can listeners really begin to implement this mentality in their life? If someone like me or anyone listening to this podcast or this morning really wanted to start doing that, how would you go about that?*

(Kristina)

*I would start any conversation and make sure that I get their name. Firstly, that is something easy to gloss over. I will say the name three times out loud in my first conversation with the individual because there’s something neurologically that locks it in more. It’s so often that we are coming with an agenda or things to say that whatever the other person that we are getting to speak to has to say or share, whether it be their name or an actual idea, we don’t store it and house it in our mind. That’s one way to be more “there you are” oriented is to focus on the name because there’s so much power in it.*

(Stella)

*I love that. And I even noticed that when I asked a question today and you were like, you repeated my name back, and I was like, wow, she really cares about my question because you repeated my name. So definitely a good way to start. So, let’s talk about your journey to Carolina. You talked this morning about how you went to high school in Georgia. There’s a lot of in-state students at Carolina. What even attracted you to Carolina or the Morehead-Cain? Tell me about your interest story.*

(Kristina)

*I am the oldest of two. I have a younger sister, but most of my life, I was the first to do things. I have always tried to seek wisdom from those who have gone before me. I had a couple of friends in high school who I saw as an older sister figure, one of whom had ties to North Carolina, went to UNC. I visited her while I was still in high school and loved the experience of Chapel Hill and the town that bled Carolina Blue. When I applied to UNC, I submitted a regular early admissions application, didn’t know what would come back. I’ll never forget, December of my senior year, while studying for my final high school literature midterm on Hamlet, I was perusing my junk mail, procrastinating, studying, and clicked on one email from UNC, one of many that was unread, and it was inviting me to apply to the Morehead-Cain scholarship. It said I was selected from the admissions pool. I had no idea what that meant. I thought it was spam. I called my older sister, pseudo-older sister Lauren, and asked her if she had any idea what this Morehead-Cain thing was, and she started crying on the phone.*

*And from there, Morehead’s application process, it felt like the first time that I was able to give a full picture of who I was based on the questions that were asked and the way that they asked them. And I remember leaving Finals Weekend thinking to myself, this is the first time I actually don’t know what I’m going to do if this doesn’t pan out. I tried to approach college admissions very open-handed. I do think it’s possible to land and orient well, whatever the circumstances may be. But it was the first time that I really, really desired something in admissions, and I’ll never forget, March ninth, 2018, 5:00 PM. I heard the yes from Morehead-Cain, and I signed my papers that night. Didn’t even wait to hear back from other schools.*

(Stella)

*That’s amazing. I had that same feeling of just… I had that same feeling of Morehead knows everything about me from this application. I talked about everything from my previous Outward Bound experience to what I was doing in high school. I did feel like they had the full picture of me. I was like, well, if they don’t want me, they have everything now. Exactly. Which is so cool. The incoming class, which I just got to meet at Final Selection Weekend, they just found out they received their scholarships and are in the process of deciding what outdoor leadership program to go on. I know that you decided to go on the Alaska trip. What made you decide to go on that trip?*

(Kristina)

*So, my family does not travel to places that don’t have outlets or flushing toilets. So, my NOLS experience was a true jumping straight into the deep end. And when I saw the list of courses, Alaska was the farthest away and the longest in duration. I strategically selected backpacking and not any additional mountaineering, given my fear of heights. And so, I gave myself one there, but I wanted it to be hard. And I knew that it was possible because there were decades of people who had gone before me. But I was really drawn to the idea of a challenge that was hand-selected for me seemingly.*

(Stella)

*And a lot of scholars have asked me or incoming scholars, about why Morehead has us go on this outdoor leadership. They’re a little nervous or anxious, similar to you. They had never done camping before, and Morehead is requiring them now to go on this long camping experience. What skills did you learn from your outdoor leadership that you still use today in maybe your role as partner?*

(Kristina)

*So, my NOLS course, with it being set in Alaska over the summer, there was nearly 24 hours of daylight. I think it was 22:30, and it got twilight-ty purple, blue in the sky from 3:00 to 5:30 a.m. But otherwise, it was bright and daytime, despite 13 days of straight rain, which we don’t speak about. But I experienced freedom like I never had before that, and freedom even from time itself. There was nothing really to stimulate me outside of just looking around and focusing on the singular goal of making it to my ex and making sure that my team and I were safe. So, bringing that level of focus and trying to cut out noise is so hard in a role that is ambiguous and requires me to seek out several opportunities in order for more opportunities to come, and work begets more work. And soon enough, I found myself having more opportunities than I could give a yes to. And I had to focus and ask myself, what is the most important thing here? And choosing that. In a similar way, I feel like I learned some of that initially on my NOLS course, and that led into my Carolina experience and onward from there.*

(Stella)

*I love that. And I am sure that the incoming scholars, which is crazy, the class of ‘29, can really go into their experience and hope that they have those same skills. I want to hear more about your minor in entrepreneurship, which I know we didn’t talk about as much this morning. That really calls me because you are in venture capital now. So, you did the minor in entrepreneurship from the Shuford program while you were at Carolina. What was the biggest lesson that you took away from these classes that even people that aren’t starting their own venture, it would be pertinent for them to learn?*

(Kristina)

*The entrepreneurship minor was strong in that it introduced me to the stories of several people who have, either successfully or unsuccessfully, started a company and scaled it. I heard war stories from them and parts about building a business that just didn’t surface in textbooks from the material that I read in class. And so while the Shuford program helped me to identify frameworks for mapping out a customer’s journey or thinking through human-centered design, which I think are important when building a product, really what was most helpful was getting in a room with people who had decades more of experience than me and being able to practice asking them questions and drawing insights from what they had to say. My entire job now is asking questions. I am a professional question asker, and it is my job to extract as much information from that founder, whether it be on their personal journey and experience prior to giving their yes to this startup or on the company itself and their vision for it. We need that information to make a discerning, strong investment decision of whether or not we are going to partner with them. And I first got to practice that with Shuford.*

(Stella)

*And you’ve talked all this morning about the questions you asked, and I love that that led you into maybe that stem of question asking is now really helping you in your current role at Eleven Tribes. So, speaking of Eleven Tribes, let’s explore venture capital. And when I first heard that you were a partner of a venture capital firm, to be totally honest, had no idea what that was and what that meant. And you even talked about this morning that you would not have known what that meant either when you were in college. So, for listeners who aren’t super familiar with venture capital, can you explain the VC approach at Eleven Tribes Ventures and more about what you do in your day to day?*

(Kristina)

*Absolutely. In venture capital, there are two core pieces to the business, and that is having capital to invest and having great founders and entrepreneurs to invest in. So, when I began in this industry, I knew very little outside of those two things. And Eleven Tribes was at a moment in its journey where I joined, and it was the managing partner and myself. The pitch was, come work for a startup that’s investing in startups. There was so much ambiguity, but with that came a lot of responsibility and opportunity to be creative with those two pieces of either attracting capital or attracting founders for us to invest in. So, at Eleven Tribes, how we think about owning our edge in the market in a particularly competitive landscape amongst emerging managers with less than 100 million under management. We are committed to not just maximizing the business outcome of that startup but also including this language of what we call the founder outcome. And so, for the history of venture capital, in the last 50 or so years, since it has started as an asset class and investment strategy, investors have focused solely on business outcomes.*

*And we measure those with exit valuations, ARR, cash flow, the like. And those are good things and worthy to strive for. And we certainly want to see our founders win on that side. But our belief is there is a part of the conversation that has historically gotten zero airtime that is more central to whether a company gets acquired or goes public on the stock market or not. And that is the founder piece. CB Insights and Harvard Business School did a study on why great founders have failed, why otherwise successful startups were wound down. And self-reported, 63% of those founders attributed failure to a people-related issue, whether it was burnout, substance abuse, sour investor relationships, co-founder conflict. The list goes on. And we’re like, why are no firms getting ahead of this or trying to take any proactive approach here? If we can mitigate some of the people issues and also invest in what happens to our teams as they grow and as they eventually walk away from their company. We think it’s not only going to be just the right thing to do, but also it will be helpful in generating a stronger financial return for our investors.*

*So, one thing that we hold ourselves accountable to as we are thinking about success across our portfolio on a quarterly or annual basis for the founder outcome is what’s the state of our founder’s most precious relationships? If they’re married, are they still together with that spouse? If they have children or friends, do those people know them and talk to them? Is there any peace in that founder’s life? What’s their health like? Physical, mental, spiritual health? Our team believes that those pieces of life are really the things that make life most worth living. And we have tried to form a strategy that brings strategic and thoughtful resources around protecting and fighting for our founder’s outcome. And what that looks like for us is dedicating 2% of capital on top of every check that we write that is non-dilutive to the founder and their team for them to spend on founder resilience activities. So that can look like therapy or coaching or co-founder health coaches, financial planners, whatever that founder needs to invest in themselves, yes, as a leader within the context of their company, but just even more broadly as a human being. Because we know that if that person is healthy and cared for and able to wake up on a Friday morning and run in the way that’s going to be required of them, the company has a much greater chance of enduring the 5, 8, 10 years that it often takes to exit their startup.*

(Stella)

*I love that. Not only do you guys question traditional venture capital norms, but you invest in it, and you prioritize that. You talked about this morning how that actually gives you guys the edge, Eleven Tribes, over some other venture capital firms, and I think that is so cool. As someone who is younger on your team, and in such a high position at the company, when you are similarly questioning maybe conventional approaches to venture capital, how do you balance respecting the older colleagues you have, but also still continuing to question without disrespecting anybody that is maybe older or have more years of experience than you do in the field?*

(Kristina)

*I have been wrestling with this for the last six or so months since I’ve stepped into this partnership role. And I try to consider my team’s personality assessments and workplace aptitudes before I think about trying to build internal conviction with an idea or a new way of doing things. So, I’m extra mindful of this given that I am the only female on my team and the youngest by a long shot. So, one thing about me is that I am a challenger personality type. I am an eight on the Enneagram. So it is energizing and natural for me to be able to take something at face value, probe a little deeper, and take in the surrounding landscape of other firms and what they’re doing well, and try to cast a vision, set a bar for us to take the good work that we’ve done and strengthen it, make it better. This has been difficult at times to share with my team in certain settings, given that resources and time is constrained. It never feels like we have enough time in the day. And so, to throw in a new vision that is more 30,000 feet above the day-to-day work, it can be poorly received at times, if not conscious of the environment that it’s shared in.*

*So, this is something that I spend much time thinking about weekly in how to go about doing great work and ensuring that our firm is ever raising the bar.*

(Stella)

*I love that. I love that you think about the context of the situation. I think that’s really important. It’s, again, “there you are” rather than, “here I am.” I love that even in that role of being in charge of something, you still are recognizing the importance of other people. Let’s talk about how, and maybe I should have asked this first, but let’s talk about how you became partner. I know it was something you talked about this morning that you weren’t expecting, but obviously, there was something that made you stand out among your employers that other people didn’t have. How can listeners like me who are about to enter the workforce, enter corporate America in a new job setting, how can we best stand out to our employees, or how should we approach entering a new workplace?*

(Kristina)

*From day one, I have considered Eleven Tribes as if I was an owner in the company. And this is also a major credit to my team and my managing partner in how he has been open-handed with the organization and the vision for it and inviting me in. And it was clear throughout my interview process that this role would not be a traditional one. Instead, there would be much opportunity to not just take existing systems and make them better, but to create systems that did not exist previously because the firm was young and budding and up and coming. So, I have felt like I have extreme ownership and lots of responsibility from the first day. And because I truly believed in our thesis and how it stood out and differentiated in the market, and I could see on every founder call how founders would soften and how it would land with them, it only created more and more buy-in from my side that, wow, I’ve stumbled upon something that is good and getting better every day, that is having real impact and creating value within this industry, despite us being still very small fish in a sea of many, many fish.*

*So, because I took on that mindset of building and owning from day one, and I tried to show up intentionally as a whole Kristina at work. I never felt like I had to compartmentalize, okay, this is my personal life. This is my professional life. I felt like I was able to come to the office, be myself, ask the questions that I would naturally ask. And then that was even better received amongst my team and everyone else in the Chicago tech and Midwest ecosystem. It was clear that there was something animating me more than just professional success or financial monetary gain. It was a true belief, and it took a long time to find an organization that I truly believed in and that I believed in more and more as I spent time at the organization.*

(Stella)

*I think that is so important. You talked about for one of your summers, you didn’t believe in the mission. You worked in private equity, and that wasn’t something that you believed in and the way that your employees were going about it. And I think it’s so you can tell by the way that you talk about Eleven Tribes that you so strongly believe in that mission and are so passionate about that job. And I hope that I can find a similar passion and listeners can find a similar passion in whatever they’re doing in the day to day. So, we’re wrapping up a little bit, but I’m curious what you would define after, and I know you haven’t been in your role for that long, but what you would say is your biggest achievement thus far. And obviously, you have many, many years of impact left. But so far in your career, you’ve had lots of amazing achievements, and I’m wondering what you would say is your biggest one.*

(Kristina)

*What’s funny about venture capital is that perception is reality, and there are long, long feedback loops. And to be honest, relatively few wins. Most companies, if things are going well, will be around 4, 5, 8, 10 years. And I am two and a half years in and still seeing the fruit of the investment decisions that I’ve helped to make. But by and large, more so than any of the pieces that could be seen as vanity metrics based on what others have said about me or the firm, working with the people that I have been able to bring through diligence and invest in, founders like Annie and Morgan of GoNanas or Brandon of Alloy or John of New Trade, I think about those people and the privilege it is that we get to be along for their journey and participate in their upside and be someone that they call in good times and in troughs. That is the biggest achievement to date is finding those people and establishing a relationship with them that we do today.*

(Stella)

*Of course, you took the humble approach to this question, and I love that you talked about the people. I do want to talk about the fact that you were recognized by Forbes 30 Under 30 for 2025 under the venture capital category. What is it like and what did you feel when you found out that you were put on this list alongside such other incredible leaders at such a young age?*

(Kristina)

*I was so surprised by the way that I felt when a friend texted me in all caps, “YOU MADE THE LIST,” when I was in the middle of a team meeting. And in the years prior, from call it 2020 through 2024, every time the list was dropped, I would study up on who made it and what their stories were, what their background was, not to copy or emulate necessarily, but to just at least have data points of who are these individuals, what outcomes are they driving, what are they giving their yeses to, and maybe I can draw some inspiration from them. When I received the news, I felt surprisingly apathetic and a little hollow in that it was something that, sure, a previous Kristina would have been enthralled to receive. But at that time of receiving it, there were so many other things, really in my personal life, that I was thirsty and yearning for and putting in intentional time and effort to go after. Being on a mountaintop moment and getting that recognition from Forbes really put into perspective what is valuable and enduring in life. And so don’t get me wrong, I am extremely grateful to be included on the list and to have Eleven Tribes’ name mentioned in a publication like that and all the opportunities that have come from it.*

*But at the same time, it made me desire more dinners at home and more trips spent visiting Atlanta where my family lives or more time in church where I get to pray and I get filled up. And as I think about my life and what I’m most proud of, not necessarily my greatest achievement, it is some of those quieter, more hidden pieces that is not going to be affirmed by many people that I will have to fight to keep at and to carve out space and time for, especially as more opportunities come. But those are the pieces that I have enjoyed and loved the most, which was just shocking to see when the Forbes news came.*

(Stella)

*I love that. I know that you had talked about your senior year of college. You felt like you had missed out on some things when you were so focused on recruiting or your next thing or your achievement. I love that in that moment. It surprised me, but it is amazing that you were able to take a realization and you realized that maybe this isn’t exactly what life is about, and maybe it is about being with family, which is your exact message that you are instilling with Eleven Tribes and your founders is, what is life really worth living for? I love that for you, it wasn’t maybe the Forbes 30 Under 30, but it was having dinner at home, going to church, being with your family. I love that. I know we just talked about not talking about your next thing, but I am curious about you. I feel like you have really explored this company that you have been in. You are now towards the top. You have made this. You had this huge accomplishment at work. What does your life look like for the next five years? Where would you like to be?*

*What would you want to prioritize for the next five years? I know you talked about intentional reflection. And what is your goal for what’s coming next?*

(Kristina)

*This is the first time in my history with Eleven Tribes that the firm is well-capitalized. So, we just closed our second fund at 46 million, ahead of our ambitious $40 million goal, which we are so grateful, so humbled to have new capital to deploy. And so now I have a modest budget to put to work. And given the resonance from founders in the industry of our thesis and knowing that we have just begun and barely scratched the surface of innovating and doing something new and unconventional in this world of venture capital, I think that there is a lot of runway with Eleven Tribes in this role. When I joined as a partner and stepped into that position, what I was bringing to the partnership that my teammates weren’t necessarily focused on already is strategic growth and partnership development. And so, I have some visions and major dreams that could shake up and be refreshing in the world of venture capital. One of which is an idea for a founder museum, the first physical space for people to come and experience the journey of a founder with, yes, all of the insurmountable highs and the incredibly low lows and this place where people can come and see the stories of the true cost of building something, not just how much money they spent in that last month, but what the founder had to sacrifice in order to achieve what they did at their company.*

*I think that that could be really powerful, and that’s one of the ideas that I’d love to chase down and may even have to strategically fundraise for outside of just our allocation of capital. And then personally, and this ties back to my experience in Georgia and something that’s followed me from Chapel Hill and even now to Chicago, this idea that loneliness is prevalent and real and we are becoming less connected and less able to even converse with each other and ask questions where the other party feels seen and the potential for a long-term friendship is made possible. Personally, I would love to have some wing of Eleven Tribes, whether that be some care foundation, spun up to invest in founders who are trying to tackle this issue, as wicked of a problem as it is with being able to identify root causes and create sustainable business models. I think there needs to be more innovation here, and hopefully, it is work that is done in this broader trend of people correcting their relationships with devices and how we think about being more human.*

(Stella)

*Thank you so much for sharing that. It was so incredibly refreshing to have this chat with you. I was super excited after hearing you chat this morning. Just for anyone going into business or venture capital who is worried about maybe these traditional approaches, worried about not finding themselves, I love that you really talked about there are companies out there that are doing good things and challenging those traditional conventions. And I just want to thank you so much for being here. I am sure that listeners are really going to enjoy this episode and thank you again.*

(Kristina)

*Thank you, Stella. This has been such a joy.*

## Episode Transcription

(Elias)

*Laura and Eleanor, thank you so much for joining Catalyze today.*

(Laura)

*Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it.*

(Eleanor)

*Thank you for having me.*

(Elias)

*Laura and Eleanor, could you share with listeners your background in disability advocacy? What was your introduction to this kind of activism?*

(Laura)

*Yeah, thank you for that question. Basically, I used to be a really active individual. I was not disabled growing up, and I played soccer, ran cross country. And after an injury in 7th grade and multiple failed surgeries and complications and different diagnoses, I ended up in a wheelchair my senior year of high school. I did not expect to be in a wheelchair going into college, but it ended up happening. And so, I had been very involved in other activist efforts and endeavors particularly related to immigrant empowerment, environmental justice, and reproductive justice, but not necessarily disability rights and accessibility. I think my biggest wake up call into this realm of activism was when I came to college and realized just how many barriers. I used to be in a small bubble where it was just really my house and my high school, and you notice different things, but not to the extent where they’re inhibiting your safety. And so coming to UNC and seeing that there were other students who were going through similar things and accessibility challenges was the reason I started getting involved. And after getting stuck in my dorm for a couple of days was really when I think my accessibility advocacy kind of took off and has been more involved now than ever.*

(Eleanor)

*And I’m Eleanor. I’m also from the Class of 2025, and I was born with a genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy. My brother and I both have spinal muscular atrophy, so we both use power wheelchairs to get around. I’ve been going to physical therapy my whole life, have had different surgeries, and now I kind of use a power wheelchair to get around every day. I use a lot of different mobility equipment in order to live independently, and I’m pretty involved on campus through the Disability Advocates Committee. It’s a really big passion of mine and has been for as long as I can remember. I’ve been advocating for my brother and I to be able to have equitable access to a lot of different public spaces and conversations. Things of that nature really need to include people with disabilities. So I’ve been advocating pretty much my whole life. But I’m really excited that UNC has kind of like a platform where students have kind of siloed this to be an important aspect of the experience at UNC. So we have a space to kind of share our experiences that are very alike and very specific to who we are and get to kind of build that advocacy within our group.*

(Elias)

*Thank you so much. How do you feel that your activism has evolved since joining the Campus Y?*

(Laura)

*I really think that the Campus Y has given me the community and the space to do a lot of work that I had been doing. I think I now have support from a large institution within the University, their staff, students, committees, and there’s even funds allocated towards activists’ endeavors. I think I have really been able to broaden my scope of what I do. Like I said, disability rights is something that’s relatively new compared to other forms of activism. I think I’ve really found my community and know that I can rely on people to host protests and actions or just create safe spaces where we can talk about these issues, and things aren’t necessarily just tried to put to the side. I think we really address them. And I think the Y is a great space to do so. I have also joined a couple of committees, apart from being on the executive board, so I’ve gotten to see it from the committee aspect, working on specific things like abolition, accessibility, et cetera. Or on the broader scope of focusing on all activist endeavors and supporting other folks who are doing things for UNC to grow to be a more accessible, inclusive, equitable place.*

*So I really think I’m just grateful for the space and what I’ve gotten because that was something I didn’t have in high school. I felt like most of it I was doing alone and relying on people, on having to reach out to people in the community. But here I feel like, you know, some of my closest friends are right there with me and they show up in support, including Eleanor.*

(Eleanor)

*Yes. Similarly, I think the Campus Y has really given us just such a great platform that is really inclusive, and everyone is able to share their perspective. And specifically with disability and disability activism, it is so important that every single perspective is included. So having the space in the Y that is an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone to kind of share their perspectives, and then for us to kind of have that horizontal leadership which allow all to really help to implement helps us to kind of communicate and all feel like we have a place and a seat at the table, so we all are able to work on really big tasks. But also making sure we support one another. Making sure that we know what each other is up to, what our passions are outside of the Campus Y. So it’s really built like a great community structure that I’ve never had before. And I don’t think, had it not been for the Campus Y and the Disability Advocates Committee to be housed within the Y, I don’t know if that community aspect would have been there otherwise, so I’m very grateful for that aspect coming into later on.*

(Laura)

*Yeah. And just to add, I think that this really is the first time in which, as activists, I think you’re often siloed to just what your work is and your value being correlated to the work that you’re putting in and the hours. But I think here, it’s really been the first time which I’ve been valued as an individual before an advocate, an activist, an accomplice, whatever you want to call it. And I think that it takes a really special group of people for that to happen.*

(Elias)

*You both talk about finding your community in the Campus Y. Laura, you’re on the executive board now. Eleanor, you work in the Disability Advocacy Committee. Before you took on these roles, what were some events that you’ve organized and committees that you led to help improve accessibility policies?*

(Eleanor)

*So last year as a first year, it was actually really exciting to see the Richards Administration and the executive branch of student government—our student body actually created a separate piece of their DEI initiative to be specifically for accessibility services. So I got to work with a really awesome senior last year, and we both worked together to create some policies from the student government perspective. So we worked on things like digital literacy and how professors go about making digital assignments accessible and what those types of policies look like and what the support looks like for that, as well as, like, how to go about using language and diction to make sure that our words have a positive impact on the way disabled students see themselves. So we worked on a lot of policies within the digital space, and then I also worked both in the DAC—Disability Advocates Committee—and a different advocacy group for disabled students called Tar Heels at the Table, where we had a lot of meetings with executive people or people of power on campus. So we met with the lead architect of the campus to kind of understand what was going on behind the scenes and how the campus isn’t accessible and what are the funding opportunities to make it more so accessible in the future.*

*We also talked a lot to a lot of, like, Vice Chancellor Amy Johnson; Kevin Guskiewicz we talked to a lot last year about so many different instances of inaccessibility that we both experienced. So we had a lot of really tough conversations, and I’m excited to see those be kind of like built upon or be the building blocks for further action this year. And then towards the end, I’m going to let Laura talk about this part, but we actually had a really, really important protest, which was super cool. So I’ll let her talk about the Y’s role in that.*

(Laura)

*Yeah, I think for me, Tar Heels at the Table was also one of the main spaces. I was invited, after expressing some of my concerns kind of early on in the year about accessibility or lack of accessibility on UNC’s campus that was published in the Daily Tar Heel, and then I also was involved with First Year Council, which is a way in which first years can really understand their role in activism at UNC and in the greater Chapel Hill community, and so started bringing those conversations more deeply into the Campus Y, and that has definitely evolved after being elected co-president of the Campus Y late last spring. And then as we started our term, Eleanor is also on the executive board. So we’ve been really working on making sure that all spaces, both the physical space, but also more of the metaphorical space, be accessible to everyone. I’ll say that after an incident that took place in February where I got stuck in my dorm, it gained a lot of media traction, making it to the Today Show, et cetera. And after that, I also started having a lot of different conversations. I worked directly with the executive director of Carolina Housing to ensure that we have a plan forward for all students who use wheelchairs to be able to have ground floor rooms and dorms and have even gone on tours with people of power and ADA directors to try and explain what isn’t and is accessible. Because one thing is ADA, but that’s the bare minimum, and that doesn’t necessarily make it accessible to all students. So I also agree that these conversations have sort of really been brought up. I think our first year, Eleanor and I did a lot of work trying to get ourselves out there and our experiences, in order to make a greater difference and make it more accessible and not have future disabled students at Carolina have to go through some of the things that we went through.*

(Elias)

*You mentioned a couple of times being trapped in your dorm room. Could you unpack that for us?*

(Laura)

*Yeah, I’ll give a brief rundown. It was definitely a traumatic experience, but basically in late February, the Koury elevators—Koury residence hall is where I was living and Eleanor was also living. I was on the fourth floor, Eleanor was on the third. The elevator went out of order, and what initially was going to be a couple hours to repair ended up being three to four days. Obviously, that’s not ideal for anybody, but for us who physically could not get out of the building without the elevator, this posed a safety risk. I had to get evacuated by the EMT group with the use of a stair chair and go down three flights of stairs. Basically imagine like a box being taken down in a cart, and that’s pretty similar to what the experience was. I’ll let Eleanor touch on her experience, but then I had to move into an empty dorm. It used to be an isolation dorm, but it was completely empty and maintenance was being done, and my mom had to come live with me on campus for about a week until we could get everything situated. And I made it clear that I wanted a ground floor room for this incoming year and also to finish my freshman year. And unfortunately, that was not granted. Apparently there were just not the rooms, and they could not make any other student move even if they were not in need of the accessible room on the ground floor. And so I ended up being moved to the second floor of Koury because I guess one flight of stairs was better than three, and then had to fight for months in order to get a ground floor room for my sophomore year. I’ve been working with Carolina Housing, trying to get something implemented where all students in wheelchairs can get access to ground floors. But ultimately I shared my experience of being trapped on social media, and it sort of blew up, and the media started reaching out, and this experience was shared all over the country. And I did it because I didn’t feel like I was being heard by UNC, and I wanted to make sure that students knew what the reality was going in and also to hope that this was going to push UNC to want to make more long-lasting change in order to better suit all of its students.*

(Eleanor)

*Yeah, so similarly to Laura, I was also on the third floor of Koury in an accessible dorm there. And I woke up on Saturday morning, and I had plans to go to brunch with my friends, and the elevator wouldn’t work. So I called someone, and I was like, “Hey, I don’t know if this is an issue, but do you all happen to have a plan?” And they were like, shocked, there was no plan. Which obviously, when you’re a freshman and you’re moving in, it’s in the back of your mind since you have a disability, but you always think, well, probably there’s a service elevator or there’s some sort of plan, but there was absolutely no plan whatsoever. And further, like, no one checked in on us to make sure we had water, food, basic necessities that one would need to live in a ten-by-ten room for three days. So thankfully, we both have really great friends and a really great support system here who brought us everything we needed and were able to support us. But we did find out that Saturday that it wasn’t going to be fixed until around Thursday morning. So obviously that’s an unimaginable amount of time if you’re asked to just sit in a room by yourself, not being able to go to classes, not being able to go to events, things like that. So my dad actually drove here. He brought a backup wheelchair that I had from when I was seven. And then my dad actually carried me down the stairs of Koury and put me in my really old small wheelchair, and then I went to my friend’s apartment to kind of wait out this serious incident. So ultimately, I think it just opened both of our eyes to how undervalued and just not thought of in the way that is respectful or even just fulfilling basic human rights. It was just really a horrible experience and not anything anyone should ever have to experience their freshman year. So I hope that through this experience, while we had it, no one a) has to have it again, and b) we can hopefully create change to where this type of incident is never given to a teenager who is asked to then navigate such a horrible experience.*

(Elias)

*I personally cannot imagine how terrifying or demoralizing that experience must have been on your guys’s parts. And I am glad that you guys are taking steps to make sure that nobody ever has to feel something like that ever again. Last year, you both organized a demonstration on the last day of class to raise awareness about current accessibility policies and injustices. Over 200 students attended. Can you explain what it was like to lead an event of this scale and how it felt to experience such an outpour of support from the community?*

(Laura)

*So ever since the incident occurred, I had been reached out to by many folks on campus, and I think that the UNC students ended up being like the most supportive group of people during this time. As to what can we do to support, how can we help? Obviously, in the immediate, there were people reaching out and willing to bring me food and bring me things that I may need, but in the long run, they wanted to do more, and obviously I knew I wanted to do more. So what began as a lot of one-on-one meetings with different individuals in the University and Carolina Housing, went into something much bigger once I was elected co-president of the Y. Knowing that accessibility was something that we wanted to prioritize, we decided that a form of direct action was going to be something that we wanted to do before we left, because something that I’m very intentional about is not letting the momentum die down. And unfortunately, that happens a lot with these issues. When an incident occurs, there is a lot of support for about a month, and then it seems like everyone forgets. But we don’t forget. We’re still here and still dealing with the same problems.*

*And so we decided to put on an event that was called Carolina for Everybody. The idea of everybody and every single body was emphasized. And basically the beginning of the action was a space where we shared our experiences. We sat on the floors of South Building because we wanted to be seen, and we wanted to make sure that we were visible. And so we sat and we told our stories, we expressed our frustrations because a lot of these issues have been things that we’ve brought up for years. Alumni came and were expressing that these were things they were fighting for, and that was really eye-opening to see when is there going to be actual, tangible, long-lasting change if there’s been students who have been doing this for so long. So we’ve had a ton of students show up, a lot of folks. We had like an open mic where folks could come and express their thoughts and their feelings, not just the organizers. And then what we did was we had put signs inside South Building that told them that we were going to be at both of the non-accessible entrances of the building, physically blocking the spaces, and that we would appreciate if in an act of solidarity, the folks in South Building would take the one singular accessible entrance in and out of the building. And so we had folks who were blocking the doors in order for everyone to have to be very intentional about seeing how we have to navigate every single day, knowing that a lot of these entrances aren’t labeled, aren’t pointed out. If the elevator were to break, then what would happen? And that’s what we have to think about often, and not just think about because it’s been our reality and we’ve had to experience it. So we just wanted folks to really understand that our experience is a real one and it’s a lived one and that it is a commodity to be able to use all five entrances of a building. And we really appreciated the students who stayed out there for hours, as well as the folks who shared their stories, and were just willing to come up to us and thank us for what we were doing because we don’t do this work to be thanked, but it is a lot of work, and it is difficult being not just a full-time student but a full-time self-advocate and then greater advocate for all disabled students.*

(Elias)

*I think that what you guys organized was really cool and brave, and I’m glad that you were able to recruit such a large portion of the student body to get involved and raise awareness about these issues. What was it like going from being a first year on campus to kind of being thrust into a role where you had to speak about so many issues in the media spotlight?*

(Laura)

*I’ll definitely say it was challenging because first of all, I felt like I had to do a lot of what I did in order for future disabled students to not have to do it. But I don’t think I necessarily had the capacity to do all of that. I had a pretty heavy course load and was involved in a lot of different things but also dealing with a lot of medical issues myself and going on trips, and all of a sudden, I am getting all of these folks from media reaching out, but also folks from administration that I had once talked to now want to reengage. And yes, I’ll definitely say it was challenging, it was not an easy thing. A lot of, the event that took place definitely affected me a lot as an individual. And so having to go straight into all of these interviews and not really even have time to process it myself was a lot. I will say I’m really grateful that I had support from different people, including Eleanor, who just understands the degree to which these things can affect you and understands just how important the advocacy is to avoid future conflicts and future problems, was really helpful and what actually helped me get through and also my family. They came and literally had to physically move me out into a separate dorm and move me back in. So there have been people that made it a lot more bearable, and I think I really grew throughout the process, and I learned who my true allies and accomplices were. And so as difficult as it was, I do think that it was an experience that opened my eyes to a lot of different things and ultimately led to this campaign of Carolina for Everybody, which we’ll touch on.*

(Elias)

*Laura, thank you so much for opening up about your experience. I wanted to follow up about that and ask how Morehead-Cain supported you throughout this process?*

(Laura)

*I think it was really more so the individuals and the community that I have within the Morehead-Cain that allowed me to get through. Like obviously some of my closest friends, having Eleanor’s support, and then some of the advisers, just to be able to talk to them about it, rant, and open up conversations about accessibility within the Morehead-Cain Foundation, not just in the greater UNC. I think there’s a lot of overlap, and things that need to be done and can be done. Eleanor and I are the first wheelchair users who have been scholars, and so there has been a lot of learning involved for Morehead-Cain staff and obviously for us. And so at least them being willing to have me share my experiences and talk about things that we can do to improve was really helpful because sometimes when talking to bigger institutions and talking to the University, it was really difficult to get through and sometimes felt like you were talking to nobody because there’s so many different people that you have to share your experiences to. So yes, I think it was really having that sense of community and having this space be one where I do feel welcome in and being part of that because I think that’s an important thing, is making sure that disabled students are actually part of the conversations was crucial.*

*And so I think that last year served as a really big learning experience for all of us at the Foundation, including my closest friends. A lot of them weren’t aware of things until they were with me and realized the different challenges. And so I look forward to seeing over the course of my four years what else we can accomplish and how we can make the Morehead-Cain Foundation and all of its programming as accessible as possible.*

(Elias)

*Well, I am glad to have you here, Laura. Eleanor, you touched base on UNC policies using exclusive language. Could you elaborate on that? And where do you see room for improvement?*

(Eleanor)

*Yeah, so as a staff member for the executive branch of UNC’s Student Government last year, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a lot of UNC leaders about what policy looks like. And we noticed that a lot of rhetoric around disabled students was either not totally holistic, so different things that constituted a disability or an accommodation, or the ways in which students get accommodations and the language around that was pretty exclusive. Or they would use person first language, which is basically saying a person with a disability instead of identity first language, which is disabled person. And a lot of people with disabilities do prefer identity first language, such as myself, I do like to use disabled person instead of person with a disability. That’s just what I’m more comfortable with. So when people specify they prefer identity first language or they prefer a certain title with their disability, the University policy was not always respectful of that or would not be totally encompassing of their disability when it comes to accommodation. So different language like that is such a minute detail that you may not think about, but it is so important in the inclusivity of people with disabilities and making sure that every single person on campus feels like this is their community and a place that accepts them*.

(Elias)

*It’s amazing to think that something so small can have such a large ripple effect on the community. So thank you for sharing. Laura, the Campus Y is home to over 1,500 students, 30 committees and organizations. What is it like to represent such a prominent body on campus, and what values do you strive for in your administration?*

(Laura)

*I try and tell myself that I don’t represent the Campus Y, I’m just a really small part of it because I think each individual who is a part of the Campus Y is what ultimately constitutes the organization as a whole. And so that includes staff, students who engage with our programming, committee chairs, folks involved in the different programs such as the Bonner Leaders Program, Global Gap Year, our Social Enterprise Innovation Team, et cetera. So with that being said, I think that the biggest thing when I was elected was the idea that we wanted to go in and make sure that each person was valued as an individual. I think our community went through a lot of collective burnout and trauma last year, especially as first years with the suicides on campus, and so we wanted to make sure that instead of just saying that we wanted to prioritize mental health and wellbeing, that we actually did certain things to express that. Previously campus-wide exec and the executive board was formatted in a hierarchy, and now it is more of a horizontal leadership. We want to make sure that each individual feels like they can share what they want to share. You don’t need to be siloed into a really specific role, and that your capacity can vary on a week to week basis and nothing is going to fall apart because of that. Because ultimately if you can’t take care of yourself, you can’t give back to whatever group you’re working for or whatever project you’re working towards. So I’ll say that a lot of abolitionist principles were implemented with horizontality, the prioritization of the individual, and also that accessibility played a really big role.*

*The other co-president, Megan, is also disabled, and we both realized that the space that the Y has is crucial and really important, and it wasn’t always as accessible as we wanted it to be. This is both in the physical and metaphorical sense. So in the physical sense, we have been working to implement, for example, like wellness rooms, making sure that furniture is accessible because previously the tables had been high tops, and that’s not accessible to folks in wheelchairs. So it’s these smaller things that you don’t necessarily realize are a problem until you’re the one going into the space or not even being able to go into the space. And so we’re creating these smaller things that to folks with disabilities, they’ll be the ones who realize and recognize it and appreciate it, and hopefully the greater community does as well because if everybody can be included, then it’s a benefit to everyone, and then in the metaphorical sense, it really does go back to the whole idea of fluctuation in capacity and that tends to happen a lot with folks with chronic illnesses like myself. I can’t always predict how I’m going to feel one day, and so knowing that there’s a group behind me that knows how to do different things and can pick up some of the work, or being okay with taking a break, I think that’s something that we have really picked up. And if one week it feels like everybody’s low capacity, then we don’t need a tight agenda, we can move on, we can talk and make the space something that feels right for us as individuals. So really, everything has been done very intentionally with the idea that we need to be okay in order for us to continue giving and continue working and being activists and advocates.*

(Elias)

*And do you feel like you’ve begun to see the effects of these changes that you’ve implemented or the fruits of your labor?*

(Laura)

*I’d like to think so, but obviously it is going to take a longer time since this is a larger institution. Any change in power is going to create a little bit of instability, a little bit of uncertainty. I think we’ve gotten over a big hump of that. And our executive board seems to be working really well together. I think folks feel comfortable sharing whatever they want to work on and knowing that if they share it, they don’t necessarily have to be the ones who have to put in all of their time and effort, because we’re all together and we’re all a community. I’ve heard from different individuals personally that they appreciate what has been done and don’t necessarily feel like this is a burden or this is another role, but more of like a space where they feel rejuvenated and can continue growing individually and helping other folks grow. And so I’ve personally seen it, and knowing that we’ve been able to implement some things that haven’t been done since years before COVID has been sort of a big thing. So getting back to direct action, for example, was something that folks didn’t have capacity for and that was totally fine. But now realizing that we’re in a time and a place where we’re sort of getting back to these things has been eye-opening, and I’d like to think some of it is attributed to the changes that were made by the co-presidency.*

(Elias)

*Awesome. Going outside of the Y, what are some physical barriers that exist on UNC campus that affect disabled students? And how are you playing a role in mitigating these barriers?*

(Eleanor)

*So with UNC’s accessibility, it’s actually very dependent on when things were built, what laws apply to them. However, a lot of it is actually a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as the 504 Plan. So these things have been implemented for about 45 years now, and so everything should be up to date, and disabled students should be able to access any and all resources that the school has to offer, including buildings, including programs, including just any type of extracurricular. Like, all of that falls within the umbrella of the 504 Plan, which was enacted over 40 years ago. So it’s really important that we advocate for the physical structure to be more accessible, since that is what Laura and I are most familiar with. So that’s kind of where we’ve been focusing. That doesn’t mean that we don’t focus on other areas, too. It’s just we try to uplift the voices that are more applicable or have experience to those different issues of accessibility.*

*So with the physical accessibility, classrooms are very inaccessible in certain buildings. My first day of class, actually, this year, I couldn’t get to my Spanish class because two elevators were out in the same building, and no one told me that this was going to be an issue. No one told my teachers, so my teacher thought I was absent. So it’s a huge issue, and you can imagine how that makes a student feel. As far as inclusivity, obviously you feel as though you’re not wanted or needed on this campus when you can’t even get to your class on the first day of school. So things like that are very, very imperative to making sure that disabled students are included and also experience an equitable and meaningful education. That’s why we’re all here, and that’s kind of what we all deserve.*

*So that’s the main thing that we’ve been focusing on right now, are the classroom accessibility. There’s over $45 million worth of maintenance that needs to be done on elevators on campus. So that’s really important to advocate for. And that funding comes from the state legislature. So it’s a very convoluted process, very hard to get funding for, but it is our civil right to access these buildings and to access our educational resources that we do come to the school for. And since disabled students, I like to say, really contribute so much to this University as far as our ability to problem solve, our ability to overcome adversity, all of those things are such important resources to this University, and we make it stronger for that reason. So it’s very frustrating when we’re kind of undervalued in a sense of, like, not being given the same opportunities in an equitable manner. So we’re focusing a lot on the educational field.*

*We’re also focused a lot on housing. Housing, obviously, is a lottery. And I touched on was a really important issue for us last year. Being stuck in our dorm for three days was not ideal, and, you know, that’s also very illegal. So making sure that we advocate that these are not only violations of rights, but they actually have a very serious impact on the ways in which we see ourselves and our space in this community. So making sure that we do not give up or relent, you know, when it’s a serious, serious, important issue, specifically on this campus. And we always also keep in mind kind of like, who’s coming in after us. And so every time we’re tired and there’s so much advocating to do on this campus, we always try to think about who’s going to be coming in after us and the legacy that we want to play.*

(Laura)

*And I’ll just add, there’s some things that folks don’t necessarily even think about. Sporting events. I am a very big Tar Heel fan, but a lot of sporting events aren’t accessible. There’s very few times in which I’ve ever been able to sit in the student section. Things like the dining halls are not accessible. It’s really difficult to navigate that in a wheelchair. We had to go on a tour that lasted over an hour, just pointing out what was accessible and what wasn’t. And I think sometimes UNC wants to put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole, but that’s not going to work, and it doesn’t work for us. Once, we went in, and we went to the tour, and there were these new accessible stickers on some tables, and we were obviously really interested because I hadn’t seen them previously. And then, unfortunately, the ADA director had to tell them that those tables were in fact not ADA accessible, so we are not able to use them. So housing and education are some of these big factors, but Carolina promised us an equitable experience. Carolina for All was something that they really emphasized and really expressed, and then coming here and realizing that we can’t take part in a lot of traditions. For example, the Bell Tower when you’re a senior. Or even the Old Well, we’ve worked really hard this past year on trying to get a ramp installed. Things that make your Carolina experience complete that we don’t get to be a part of. And so making sure that these small details that seem small on the outside and that we tend to put up with, but over time they build up and really impact the experience that you have as a student are also things that we’ve made sure to bring to the table and want to emphasize and resolve.*

(Elias)

*How do you believe alumni can engage with UNC to improve its accessibility?*

(Eleanor)

*So this is actually a really big thing that we’ve been looking into recently because we’ve had some conversations with different disability rights activists across the country, and we’re really looking at ways in which we could implement a more equitable experience at UNC. And we talked a lot about how we just do not, as college students and teenagers, have the resources or the knowledge of what our rights are, what can be done about them, how we go about implementing radical change on this University’s campus to make sure that we’re included in a meaningful way. So I think not only from an advocate and an activist role that the alumni have a place in, but also just making sure that if you are an alumni with certain resources, such as understanding civil rights or education, and how the different mechanisms in the bureaucratic system within both of those work. If you have any knowledge in both of those, those are really important pillars that we just cannot supplement ourselves, and we really do not have the capacity to do. But we would really appreciate if alumni who have vast experience in these fields—and I know a lot of Morehead Alumni specifically do—if they had the resources or the time to have these important conversations with us and with UNC leadership, it would not only mean so much to this current student since we are currently at UNC, but also to the students coming in, and what we kind of want Morehead and UNC to look like for disabled students in the future.*

(Laura)

*Yeah, I agree. And I think that just touching on, you know, if there is financial support, pushing the University a little bit on being intentional about making sure that whatever this is going towards includes disabled students. I think it’s really easy to forget that we exist, but we’re here, and we hope that this makes it clear that we’re here, and we want to do so much, and we want to contribute, and we are contributing, but yeah, some of the resources we don’t have, and so in whatever capacity that looks like, just making sure that disabled students are going to be included in whatever role you provide.*

(Elias)

*My final question for you both. What do you view as the most impactful aspect of your work?*

(Eleanor)

*I think the most impactful aspect of our work has been when we’ve been able to make those connections that are really important to the student body. So when we did Carolina for Everybody, it was so cool to hear the impact after the fact. I just had a conversation in the Disability Advocates Committee about the event, and if we wanted to do something in the future like that, and everyone’s response was like we’ve never felt so seen by the University, we’ve never felt like so just loved by this community, or seen and valued. So that’s kind of like what we’re going for, and that’s what we want to make those connections in the future. So I think that’s hopefully the greatest impact when we leave here because we are both very futuristic in what we want this school to look like and what we want our impact to be. I think making sure that every single student is activated on this cause, and knows about it, and knows that how to make other disabled students feel welcome is to stand up for our rights and say, “This is a really important cause.” And then also having alumni connected as well to the story, hearing our story, hearing our experiences, and utilizing their resources to make this University better, is so important.*

*And that’s been really cool to see the professors and the alumni reach out to us and say, “How can I help?” Because that is so important, and we can’t do it alone. So making sure that we are making those connections that are so vital to increasing our impact is just the coolest thing ever, and being able to share our perspectives and having an impact from that is really awesome. So I’m really grateful to you guys for inviting us on, and I hope that we’ll be back with some cool updates in the future.*

(Laura)

*Yeah, I think in the short term, it has been those small tokens of appreciation or of love and support. The messages I’ve gotten on Instagram or emails from professors just thanking us, apologizing for what happened, things like that were really crucial to that time. It was a difficult time of having to meet with folks and basically trying to express to somebody why I deserve to have equal rights. We weren’t even going for equitable at that point. It was really draining. And so folks who were there to support meant the world, and I think that most impactful is just the idea that, in the future, no student will have to do this. And you can be a full-time student, be involved in whatever you want, but don’t necessarily have to be a full-time self advocate or have to go through three hoops just to get what everybody else gets. And so I think that idea and radical re-imagination of a campus that’s accessible for everybody is sort of what keeps me going and what makes me smile when the things in the accessibility world get tough.*

(Elias)

*Laura, Eleanor, the pleasure is all ours. Thank you so much for being here with us today.*

(Eleanor)

*Thank you for having us.*

(Laura)

*Thank you.*

**Emily Vasquez ’06** joined Catalyze on the Saturday afternoon of the 2022 Morehead-Cain Alumni Forum in Chapel Hill this past October. Earlier that morning, she delivered a SEVEN Talk entitled, “[The Social Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1882&v=WTuMP2vdGtE&feature=youtu.be),” to over 500 Forum attendees.

During this episode, recorded on campus in the Pit, Emily shares with scholar host Elias Guedira ’25 about her ethnography research in Mexico and its parallels to the U.S. healthcare system. Her work investigates how the development of a national human genome has exacerbated social inequalities.

[Listen to the episode](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/how-a-national-genome-can-reinforce-social-inequality-with-emily-vasquez-06-ethnographer-of-science-medicine-and-public-health).

Emily is a Bridge to the Faculty Postdoctoral Fellow in the department of sociology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she teaches courses on the sociology of health and medicine and on race and ethnicity in scientific and medical practice. Her research examines how social inequalities are entangled with and reinforced through the production of medical knowledge and technologies. Emily’s work has been published in the journals Engaging Science, Technology, and Society; American Anthropologist; Perspectives on Science; and Medicine, Anthropology, Theory, among others.

## Episode Transcription

(Elias)

*Emily, thank you so much for joining the Catalyze podcast this afternoon.*

(Emily)

*Great to be here with you. Thank you.*

(Elias)

*For our listeners, we should point out that we are sitting in the Pit on campus, so we’re likely to hear alumni and scholars as they head about to their free time activities.*

*I’m sure fall in Chapel Hill is a bit different than in Chicago. How’s it been returning to campus for the Forum? Are you enjoying your stay?*

(Emily)

*Oh my goodness. We got so lucky with the most beautiful weekend. I cannot believe this weather. It is the hardest time of year to travel because you don’t know how to pack, right? And it’s weird that days can be like a span of 30 degrees, so 70 degrees at the warmest and 40 degrees later on, but it’s really special to be back here, and we’re just blessed to have such a beautiful weekend. Totally. I’m psyched. I didn’t expect to be this excited.*

(Elias)

*I am in agreement with that. The weather has been remarkable. Emily, have you been able to reconnect with any of your former classmates?*

(Emily)

*Yes, really, really close friends I haven’t seen, in part because of the pandemic, but also because before the pandemic, I was doing fieldwork in Mexico for several years, for about four years, and so I just haven’t seen people, haven’t met their kids yet. And so it’s just really wonderful to get to see people’s homes, people who have moved back to Chapel Hill and that sort of thing, so it’s been a wonderful reunion, and I think we just got lucky that we’re all here. Like, I’ve never come to a Forum before, and so it’s just wonderful that it was a really good turnout.*

(Elias)

*I’m so glad you were able to reconnect with all of your friends and loved ones. I hope you were able to attend our Food Truck* *Rodeo, which happened later in the evening. Were there any particular highlights from the night?*

(Emily)

*Yes, the lobster rolls. I only recently started eating lobster rolls, and I’m so impressed by how, I thought they would be heavy, and they’re kind of light. It was a very good selection of options last night. It was really fun. But it did get chilly.*

(Elias)

*That it did, real quick. I enjoyed your SEVEN Talk this morning, as well, which you entitled “The Social Life.” I was particularly struck by your commentary on health being viewed as an individual responsibility by the government rather than the outcome of a larger system. What’s one big takeaway that you hope the audience got out of your talk?*

(Emily)

*That it’s okay for health to be political, for people to engage, for people to take a stand in terms of the kind of society that they want to live in. We happen to live in a country where more money is spent here on healthcare than in all other developed countries, but we have some of the worst health outcomes. Like, I think if you look at the graphs, we’re like twenty-first in terms of country performance on healthcare spending versus health outcomes. And so I don’t think that we are on the right path. And I think something needs to change, and that will require voting. It will require mobilization. It will require people who are going into the field of medicine or health sciences to think about their work in a different way. That it is a bigger social project than just a job.*

(Elias)

*Thanks so much for making that point, and I really hope that people attending the Forum took away this message and are able to employ it in their futures. For reference, if any of our listeners weren’t able to attend the Forum, we livestreamed all the SEVEN Talks this morning on our YouTube page, so we’ll make sure to link Emily’s in the episode description. Emily, you describe your research as examining how social inequalities are entangled with and reinforced through the production of medical technology. Broadly speaking, what do you mean by that?*

(Emily)

*Yeah, I think the easiest way into understanding this is to give an example, and one that I’ve just been thinking a lot about lately is the politics around the deaf community and cochlear implants. So there’s been just really a lot of good books. There’s a great book called True Biz that came out this year, a really wonderful movie that people saw, CODA. I had an amazing deaf student who used a cochlear implant in my class. We’ve talked a lot about what it’s like to be deaf with a cochlear implant and without. There is debate, there is controversy in the deaf community over whether or not using that technology, the ability to hear—it’s a very imperfect technology, we should say, we should point out—is better, is desirable, or not. There is so much richness in the deaf community, in terms of communicating with sign language. It’s a form of communication that people who don’t speak sign language or American Sign Language, we just can’t communicate in this way. And it’s something really special in a way that you have a special way that you communicate with your friends that makes that relationship so close. It is something that bonds people. And so, often this decision is made by parents, it could be made by doctors, but it’s rarely made by a child who experiences deafness to have a cochlear implant. But it’s a really permanent kind of change in your life. So here’s what happens in this situation: there’s a possibility for a technology that could enable hearing, that could make a person able to function in broader society the way that it is. But that disincentivizes really learning sign language. It disincentivizes the depth of those relationships that somebody might experience by being in a community of people who share that. And so that’s what I mean by social inequality, is perhaps we have a technology and medical technology here that we think is useful, positive, improving someone’s life, but perhaps we’re not recognizing fully that there are other ways of living life that can be very rich. And we are not valuing those when we value a technological solution. There’s many ways to answer this question, and this particular topic is just very fraught. Like, I think if you’re listening to me now, hopefully these comments are just a starting off point for reading, for watching really great documentaries on this topic, or for talking to people who are deaf and can share this experience.*

(Elias)

*Thank you so much. Emily. I wanted to move over to your research that you conducted in Mexico. For reference, I noticed that a large portion of your research concerns genomic identities in Latin America. For background, could you outline any differences between American political views leaning towards a socially salient ethnic identity versus traditionally Mexican ones?*

(Emily)

*I was doing a master’s in public health at Columbia and so thinking a lot about how we study people in the United States, and that is definitely through the lens of the racial regime that dominates in the United States, which is really about discrete categories, black versus white. Very little recognition, especially in like formal statistics of a mixture of people who are an eclectic mix of all kinds of different people and places. I wanted to think about these issues as a sort of comparative. I wanted to go to Mexico and think about epidemiology, think about the categories that are used in medicine and public health, under a different racial regime. The idea of “Latino” is a U.S. construct born and developed and cultivated in the United States, bringing together heterogeneous communities. And so that there’s another scale of understanding identity in terms of indigenous, in terms of mestizaje, in terms of whiteness and brownness in Mexico, that our statistics, our science in the United States doesn’t capture. But I was curious how Mexican epidemiologists were thinking about this. I planned to do this project, which was going to be my dissertation, and just as I sort of was finalizing the plan, about to defend the proposal, a wonderful book came out addressing exactly this, which is called Mestizo Genomics. It’s a collaboration led by Peter Wade, and they’re looking at Mexico, but also Brazil, Colombia . . . I’m trying to think of any other countries are involved in the project, but they did fieldwork with lots of collaborators in genomics laboratories thinking about how is it that people are understanding who it is that they’re studying, what groups within the country are salient, and where do those ideas come from.*

*My particular question that I wanted to add, and I think I have—I didn’t do exactly the project that I had imagined because sort of so many of the answers had . . . here was the book explaining. But I was very interested in understanding science in each country. Medicine in each country doesn’t exist in isolation, right? How do epidemiologists who collaborate frequently between the United States and Mexico communicate across these different categories, different conceptions? This is also very relevant in, I mean, especially as medicine moves toward a reliance or an interest in big data, pooling data from all over the world. Analyzing this data statistically requires categories. But what categories are to be used? Can we use similar categories when we’re bringing together genomes from the United States and from Brazil and from Mexico? How do we group?*

*The other question is, in a world where evidence-based medicine really is the norm, would Mexican epidemiologists, would Mexican physicians and public health experts, to what extent would they feel that they could rely on evidence collected in the United States about Latinos? So those were sort of some of the motivating questions. And what assumptions would it require on their behalf to make that leap? And, I mean, just to sort of answer some of the questions that I’m posing, that leap is made a lot. More than I would expect. I think, actually, even though very few people in Mexico and many other spaces throughout Latin America identify as Latino, as you do with an experience in the United States. In medicine, I think this is a particular arena where that kind of diffusion of the category is taking place. So, like, if you go to pharmaceutical conferences, evidence from Latino samples taken in the United States is leveraged to prove that a drug works or how it’s going to work. And so I think this is language that’s becoming, or a belief that’s becoming more and more salient in the medical arena.*

(Elias)

*I found the part where you started talking about the Latino or Latinx identity being such a U.S. construct. So what categories currently exist in Mexico for defining ethnicity? I mean, when we’re looking at it from an American standpoint, we tend to be glossing over a lot of rich culture, and there’s a lot of value in that. So how does the Mexican government go about, for example, identifying and classing those different identities? And how is this monitored?*

(Emily)

*Yeah. So as I thought more about and wanted to learn more about this sort of epidemiology across borders and understand how biomedical researchers deal with these differences, I did learn quite a bit about Mexican epidemiology, and I think categories of rural and urban are actually a lot more important than the way that in the United States, epidemiology is organized primarily around race. That said, Mexico, like everywhere, is always changing, major flux. I think there is so much more recognition recently around AfroMexicanidad, like that there are people with African roots, and recognizing, I mean, capturing that in the census, capturing dimensions of discrimination that are related to that in health research. There is, even in the last just couple of years, a lot more recognition around this. And so I don’t want to suggest that the categories in Mexico are static or stable. I think they’re changing and being rethought at the same time that ours are. As perhaps in the United States, we’re trying to deal more with complicating gender, we’re also thinking more about how to deal with mixed race status, for example, in the census and epidemiology. In a good way, I think a lot of people across the health sciences are asking some of these good questions.*

(Elias)

*For context, we saw how the Mexican conception of an ethnic identity changed over time, as we were talking about the mestizaje or mestizo identity during Spanish colonization, this was propelled by a very nationalistic notion of a cosmic race. Could you kind of unpack what that term means for listeners? And do we see any ripple effects of this very mixed nationalistic identity on the class structure today in Mexico?*

(Emily)

*Yeah, so really like, this idea of mestizaje, which is being mixed primarily between European and Indigenous descent, was really mobilized in Mexico at the time of the Mexican Revolution to suggest, to create solidarity around an identity that was different from being European. That in \[José\] Vasconcelos’s work on the cosmic race was unique and uniquely powerful, something around which the kind of lore you build a nation. The issue with mestizaje, which is interesting because it is to an extent inclusive because it’s about a mixture, it’s about not everybody being the same, and yet it is about people being the same in their mixedness. And so there are still exclusions. So when a country promotes mestizaje, as it has been historically promoted in Mexico, at the same time you’re othering the Indigenous and, in Mexico’s case, very much erasing, ignoring the presence of Afro-Mexicans.*

*And this happens also in genomic data. I wrote a paper called “Mexican Samples, Latino DNA” and talked with Mexican genetic epidemiologists who were doing work on Mexican samples. And when they found African ancestry, a lot of times those samples were removed as outliers because it created too much noise and complication in the kind of analysis that they were trying to do.*

(Elias)

*But it’s just that. It’s that exclusion, right? This is at a time where we’re still fighting for the inclusion of basic groups in an American society, too. We’re still struggling to even acknowledge the existence of LGBT individuals in schools. So I think it’s something that evolves over time, and it’s extremely interesting to hear how at this stage right now, Mexico is still coming to terms with this colonialistic notion and the repercussions that it’s had in its history. Thank you for speaking about that.*

*So I kind of wanted to talk about your research, “Mexican Samples, Latino DNA.” And for this research, you were stationed at the Faculty of Science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and Mexico City. And you acknowledge the motives and findings of genomic research funded by and designed by philanthropic organizations such as the Carlos Slim Foundation. So could you preface our listeners by describing who Carlos Slim is and his link to this genome project that he helped establish?*

(Emily)

*Carlos Slim is the wealthiest man in Mexico, the wealthiest man in Latin America, and for a while, the wealthiest man in the world. His sort of position on Forbes’s list of the world’s wealthiest was overtaken by Bill Gates about a decade ago, or a little bit more. But his economic power in Mexico is pretty overwhelming. There’s a joke and a really great biography written of him. And it’s two couples . . . sorry, it’s a couple, so it’s two people, they’re talking on a cell phone, and they’re fighting. And finally the guy interrupts the conversation and says, “Let’s stop fighting. The only person benefiting here is Carlos Slim.” Because Slim is a telecommunications mogul and owns cellphone access, so the minutes that they were spending fighting were benefiting Carlos Slim. But certainly far beyond telecommunications, the economic reach is everywhere, to civil infrastructure like airports, laboratories, like medical laboratories, hospitals. People say people in Mexico walk on his streets and sleep in beds with sheets made by companies that are owned ultimately by Carlos Slim.*

*Around 2007, 2010, Slim really ramped up his philanthropic investments in Mexico and Latin America. It was sort of like a regional look, investing a lot of money into especially health. One of the projects that Slim funded through the Carlos Slim Foundation is called SIGMA, which is the Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas. What’s interesting about this project, the focus was cancer and diabetes. The idea that Slim and the foundation put forth was that it was necessary for there to be science, funded in Mexico and Latin America, looking specifically at “Latin American and Mexican” genomes because they were not sufficiently included. These groups were not sufficiently included in samples, for example, in the most powerful institutions doing genetic and genomic research in the United States and in Britain, the UK. And so there was a rhetoric here about inclusion, once again, that they were funding science that was meant to be on Mexicans by Mexicans for Mexicans. But what’s also very interesting about this particular project is that much of the work, sort of the core leader, the institutional leader, was actually in the United States at the Broad at Harvard and MIT. And I asked the executive director of the foundation, “If the idea is to promote science, to do genomic research specifically on Mexican and Latin Americans, why then are you doing this at the Broad in Boston? And the answer was, well, Mexico established National Institute of Genomic Medicine, but the leaders in the world that are doing this at the speed that we want this done, the genetic analysis, but then, being able to do something with that data, to translate their findings into technologies—and I can tell you more about the technologies that they’ve developed. They wanted to function on a different timeline. And I talk about this sometimes as entrepreneurial time. Like, these sort of very nationalistic ideas that surrounded the investment, they’re in competition also with these other values, like how do we create, how does this basic science analysis get translated into a product that then makes it to people’s bedsides as quickly as possible? I think, coming from a very entrepreneurial world, this is a particular vision or an approach to doing science that the Slim Foundation brought to this part. So what ended up happening, it wasn’t just samples from Latin America, it wasn’t just samples from Mexico that were used or continued to be used in the SIGMA projects. They had a large influx of samples through a collaboration with a California research group. And so the Mexicanness of many of the samples is no longer just Mexican. Some of this information is actually missing to really understand the social identity or the ancestral identity of people that are in the California sample. What’s interesting is some of this work, it is about Mexican DNA, but a lot of the findings are published under the heading of Latino risk, Latino genetic risk.*

*There’s a sort of a parallel reading of this project or the way that this project went. It is inclusive. It is thinking about Latino identity or perhaps thinking about findings that can be applicable not just in Mexico or throughout Latin America, but, in the case of Slim, when we’re thinking about translation and a marketable product, sort of, coming as quickly as possible, there’s a marketing dimension to what categories can do. And so a category that is panethnic, and then if you’re tailoring a medical device to an ethnicity, which has its own politics, tailoring it to a panethnic identity creates much bigger markets than Mexico alone.*

(Elias)

*So you mentioned the Carlos Slim Foundation kind of overall being the driving factor in delivering something to the bedside, which had me wondering, can you explain how a country’s choice to invest in a national genome bank centralizes its role in the global economy? And why do you think people are more interested in investing in this field of research rather than clean water or providing clean air to citizens?*

(Emily)

*Investment in genomics in Mexico preceded, really began before Slim’s investment. Slim’s investment came later. The first investments were public, from the Mexican State Building and National Institute of Genomic Medicine, similar to one of our NIH Institutes. At the time, also in the United States, but around the world, there was a great deal of interest in genetics and genomics. Yes, from a health perspective,—“Where can this take medicine?”—but also a recognition that this could perhaps become an industry. Many people understood genetics and genomics in this developing, emerging world of science—and we’re talking here like very late 1990s, early 2000s—as the source of a new global bioeconomy. And there were fears that middle-income countries that could invest in science, if they didn’t invest in this kind of science, they might be left out from that kind of growing global bioeconomy. And so there were entrepreneurial physicians, scientists, in Mexico who lobbied the government, who mobilized the government, to make major investments in genomic medicine. Yes, with health in mind, but also with the national economy in mind. Especially when it comes to thinking about prevention efforts, it is much more likely, globally, that we will get prevention efforts that in some way lead to profits for someone. It is very difficult to disrupt profitmaking or even disrupt, sort of, the values around capitalist production and that being the strength of a country. That we would disrupt Coca-Cola, we would disrupt Nestle, and actually say, “What you’re doing as a business who does employ many people in our country is really harmful for health.” So we tend to get prevention options that have a money-making possibility. And genetics and genomics absolutely did, does, continues to, and the real profit potential with genetics and genomics comes from making diagnostic technologies, where you would scan someone’s genome and understand what they’re predisposed to versus not predisposed to. The other side is, once you understand better the genetic mechanisms, genomic mechanisms, you can create pharmaceuticals to address them. And so there, sort of, a parallel field developing at the time was pharmacogenomics, which was exactly this idea, that this would then lead to drugs, which is the industry. But no one—there’s not a huge foundation pouring resources into public health interventions that would disrupt capitalist order.*

(Elias)

*I found it really fascinating during your SEVEN speech when you started talking about activism in Mexico. And I kind of wanted to revert this question back to the U.S. in a little bit. You mentioned the Black Panther movement during the civil rights era and how they actually started to distinguish relationships between medicine, technology, and social inequalities. Can you elaborate how these relationships affect the lives of minorities living today?*

(Emily)

*Yeah. So thinking about the U.S. context, this question is particularly salient, and it really goes back to precisely what I was talking about before, in terms of what kind of prevention efforts do we get? People come from all over the world to seek specialized medical care in the United States because we have the capability to do things because of investments, public investments, in science that in other countries are not available. So we’ve made a choice in this society to invest in technology, invest in specialization, invest in high-cost treatments. We haven’t put a lot of investment in a) using the evidence that we have about very basic public health interventions. What does this mean? People who have a lot of resources and have great access to healthcare can get some of the best care in the world available, in this country. But in terms of our population and thinking about outside of that one percent, the likelihood of being as healthy as somebody in another developed country, if you’re in the United States, is much lower. And of course, in the United States, we know that resources map onto other social inequalities like race because of historical racism in this country.*

*And so there’s just a perpetuation, I think, unfortunately, rather than what the Black Panthers envisioned, in terms of remaking healthcare in a way that would help to undo inequality, that would prevent illness in poor, black communities, and therefore, promote not only health, but economic well-being, generational wealth, for example. Those strategies were limited in terms of the Black Panthers’ activism, in terms of them being scaled up. And so we’re left with our current situation, which is the one I explained before with the great potential, if you have resources.*

(Elias)

*Emily, thank you so much again for spending time with us, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time at the Forum and in Chapel Hill.*

(Emily)

*Thank you. This was so much fun.*

## Episode Transcription

(Elias)

*Chris, thank you so much for joining the show.*

(Chris)

*Elias, thank you for having me. It’s great to be here.*

(Elias)

*It’s been about a year and a half since you’ve assumed your role as Morehead-Cain’s president. How do you feel?*

(Chris)

*I feel great. It’s hard to believe it’s been 18 months, to be honest. I feel like I arrived here yesterday, and yet I’ve also built relationships in the time that I’ve been here that I feel that I’ve had for so much longer than 18 months, just as a result of the depth with which I’ve been able to get to know members of this community—scholars, staff, alumni. It’s a wonderful place to be*.

(Elias)

*What do you feel like has been the most surprising thing about members from this community? Did you have any first impressions that were kind of torn down as you got to meet people a lot better?*

(Chris)

*Well, the thing that blows me away at Morehead-Cain is simply how pleasant and friendly everyone is. I’ve just had the opportunity to get to know people in ways that I think I wasn’t fully accustomed to, and get to know people early as a result of a shared culture and a shared set of values that have existed here over a long period of time. We just had our Forum, Elias, as you know, and the thing that was so neat is to see members of the classes of the 1970s in conversations with members of our classes of 2020s, and to the see that those classes look very different just because the university has changed in so many ways, but so many of the underlying character attributes are the same. And you see those collide with each other in conversation. And it’s a really wonderful thing to be a part of.*

(Elias)

*I’m so glad that you’ve had such a positive experience since joining the team. What was your focus or goals when you started and what have you learned, and what do you look forward to learning more about?*

(Chris)

*When I arrived here, I was personally going through a massive contextual change. I had been living in the Global South. I had been working with secondary school students who were transitioning to university and students who were from a very diverse environment but all across the African continent. I was moving to the Global North, a very high resourced university with students who are primarily from the United States and half of whom are from the state of North Carolina, where I’d never lived before. And so, it was important to enter that with some level of humility and just seek to understand this place and also understand the scholarship program at Morehead-Cain. I have great respect for history and for the institutional customs and norms that build over a period of time, and it was clear that there were so many things that were so strong as a function of a culture that had been built over many years, and I wanted to make sure that I understood that versus simply trying to leave my mark. My success is going to be a function of my being one of this community rather than simply being in a position of leadership in this community. And I hope that others perceive me as having had some success in learning this space. I think I’m still learning this space every day. I’ve enjoyed that challenge immensely.*

(Elias)

*So as you’ve transitioned from your former African Leadership Academy, coming to North Carolina and really immersing yourself in this space, what have you found to be some very effective ways to kind of get to know the culture of Chapel Hill and get to know the student body better?*

(Chris)

*Well, one of the ways I get to know the student body is by having people stop into my office. And so, this is a good plug for any scholars who listen to this podcast to know that they can just set an appointment with me on the MCN, as you have, Elias. And so it’s been so fun to have people stop through the office to have conversations. But also, I have a young family, and so that means that we often do walks through campus and will bump into scholars in situ, which has been a really wonderful experience for us. When I take my daughter to a volleyball game, and I run into a group of your classmates and am able to sit with them and have a conversation about their life at Carolina at that time, it’s a really special and fun thing for me.*

(Elias)

*Right. And going off of that, I just saw you the other day at Purple Bowl up on Franklin Street. What have you found to be your favorite food spots around town?*

(Chris)

*Well, my daughter would say Ben and Jerry’s, which she knows is run by Uncle Antonio—Antonio McBroom, who is a Morehead-Cain Alum. I would probably say Sutton’s, simply for the historical value associated with Sutton’s. It was one of the first places I went when I got here, and I really enjoy it.*

(Elias)

*Wonderful. So, Chris, 2022 was a year of transition for just about everyone. What is Morehead-Cain like, post-COVID-19, for prospective scholars? And have you spotted any trends?*

(Chris)

*This is a great question because I wasn’t here before COVID-19, but I had a sense of a community when I arrived that was tired for a lot of reasons. We had COVID-19, which is just a very difficult environment for any educational institution, and we had COVID-19 here at UNC-Chapel Hill on the heels of a Silent Sam reckoning that, I think, was very challenging for a number of members of our community and our student body. And so, I experienced a community that was tired, and a number of scholars who were hopeful of having a university experience that they really believed in. People were really excited about being Morehead-Cain Scholars, but hadn’t had the opportunity to live the Morehead-Cain experience. This term has been one of the most joyful I have ever experienced in schools as I walk through campus. And I think it’s a function of students really stepping into—both Morehead-Cain scholars and students across the UNC campus—really stepping into the opportunity to be back in college, enjoying their life as a scholar, and enjoying everything that a university like this has to offer because so many of those things were simply not available over the past two years.*

*And so, this has been a wonderful time, I think, for so many, and I hope that we can maintain that level of energy and enthusiasm about learning, about scholarship, about research, about intercultural collisions, about attending collegiate events in terms that follow. Like, I hope we’ll remember how it felt to return post-COVID, and we won’t take the things here for granted in the terms that come.*

(Elias)

*Now, over the past year, there have been many conversations around a set of commitments established in 2021. What progress have you seen being made, and how has the community helped?*

(Chris)

*Thank you for that question. I think this is one of the most important things that I needed to do in the first year, was capture a whole range of inputs, including a survey that so many members of our community, scholars, staff, and alumni contributed to, with respect to important questions of diversity and inclusion in Morehead-Cain. And coming out of that, we recognized that there are a set of timeless community commitments that we need to make, which you can find on the MCN in the President’s Corner section, that will take us years of continuing to grow towards our ideals. One is building intentional community of scholars from all different backgrounds who will thrive together as scholars on this campus and beyond as an intergenerational community. Another is expanding opportunity and making sure that the Morehead-Cain is accessible to the most extraordinary young leaders, regardless of where they are. A third is to foster discourse and learning and really invest in the type of dialogue and learning that comes from intimate conversation and a collision of ideas. And finally, ensuring that our programming is impactful for all young leaders, regardless of their background. Everyone who enters this experience deserves an experience that is college as it should be, and we need to be thoughtful about assessing the quality of our experience for every scholar and understanding where we are delivering and where we might be falling short.*

*I think there are a number of things that over the last year we can point to that show progress in these areas. There are some simple things. When we walk into the spaces, we can see our community represented in a way that reflects the intentionality of our community. We see art from elders in our community, as well as from current scholars in our different spaces and lighting up our spaces and asking us important questions, whether it’s Thomas Sayre’s pieces in the Scholar Lounge or scholar drone shots that are in the Dickson Room. We have questions that we’ve asked in selections that I think have both improved the rigor of our selection process, but have also uncovered places where we’re falling short. One place that I’m particularly aware that we need to do better is attracting rural scholars, for example. When we dig into the data, we see that while we run a process that sees scholars equally likely to progress every phase of our funnel, whether they are white, black, male, or female, if you cut that data differently, and you look at urban scholars versus rural scholars, we see that rural talent is less likely to shine in our process. And we have to ask what it is about our process that might be obscuring talent that we should be confident exists. Because we have a very proud history here of recognizing and attracting extraordinary rural talent into this program, and we can see that across our alumni community. And there’s much more that I think our entire community and listeners to this podcast can find in our Year in Review about our progress in each of these areas. What I want to note is that this work is not work that you undertake in a day or a month or a year or you put out a statement and it’s over. We need to assess our progress on these four big ideas every single year and then craft objectives for the year to come that we will tackle with verve.*

*So this year, in addition to the rural scholars question, I’m excited about progress that I think we’ll make in two areas in 2023. One is ensuring that we are modeling inclusion for scholars with disabilities for this campus and others. And we have learned so much and enjoyed so much the presence of scholars with disabilities in this community. But we also have seen, as you might have heard on a recent Catalyze podcast which you hosted with Laura and Eleanor, some of the challenges that extraordinary students on this campus face as a result of differing abilities. We need to ensure that we are setting the standard there, and there are some changes that we’ve made to our spaces and changes that we will make—we will have a lift, for example, that we’ll install in the ground floor this year—that will improve flow through the space, a small but important thing. We’re going to enhance our nominating partnerships that can access scholars with disabilities and make clear that we are a place that looks for extraordinary talent with disabilities. And that will be a win for us, and then we’ll also focus heavily on this rural scholar question, and we will, I hope, focus heavily on this question of discourse and dialogue with some initiatives that we’ll undertake, both scholar-led and program-led, in the term to come.*

(Elias)

*Thank you, Chris. Now you talk about initiatives being scholar-led and program-led, how would you say the Morehead-Cain community, in general, is getting involved with making the Morehead-Cain scholarship more accessible to rural students, particularly alumni and current scholars?*

(Chris)

*Oh, that’s an awesome question, and I think that we have not yet answered that question as fully as we need to. And if there are people listening to this podcast who think, “I want to be involved in supporting rural scholar identification,” or “I want to be involved in any of these priorities,” I hope they’ll reach out to me directly at [chris@moreheadcain.org]() because we would love to harness scholar and alumni participation in every one of these priorities.*

*One of the things that I think is so exciting here, Elias, is just the way in which our scholars and our alumni are able to connect with each other. The level of alumni participation at Morehead-Cain is extraordinary, from giving to the program to, more importantly, responding to emails when scholars reach out to an alum with a question, that alum always responds, to participating in the selection process. We have about 500 alumni who invest time in evaluating scholars in different phases of our selection process, ensuring that every candidate is reviewed by a diverse set of reviewers who understand this community, this place, its values. And that’s been a massive source of our success over the past 75 years.*

*And as we think about these challenges ahead of us, like the rural challenge, it’s going to be a question of how we capture alumni input and engagement that will help us crack that in ways that see Morehead-Cain become accessible to the most promising young leaders in all different backgrounds. And once we’ve cracked or feel we’ve made progress on the rural issue, we will inevitably find another community that we feel we have not appropriately expanded opportunity to. And that will be one that we’ll need to focus on next. And at every phase, we’ll have to find ways to get alumni involved, whether it’s going back to their schools, supporting selection in their local regions, or proposing ideas that can help us break down some of the barriers that might exist for prospective applicants today.*

(Elias)

*So, Chris, taking into account the full picture and thinking longer term beyond the selection process, what opportunities do you see for Morehead-Cain?*

(Chris)

*As I came in here, one of the questions I was asking was, we’ll have our centennial in 2045, and where do we want to be, and what’s the impact that we hope we will have had on the world as an organization and as a community in 2045, at the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Foundation. And I think that there are a set of questions that we have to ask ourselves in order to wrap our heads around Morehead-Cain in 2045. One is, how do we want to see this program evolve such that we are identifying and investing in and empowering dynamic leaders who will shape the future over that time frame and beyond? And that includes continuing to expand opportunity in our admissions process and identify the most extraordinary leaders, as we’ve just described, but it also includes shaping the future of the program itself. How do we want to see the program evolve, and what are the opportunities we see to deepen leadership development of every scholar over the course of your time in the Program?*

*The second question is, how do we think about Morehead-Cain as this platform and the set of things that we’ve learned how to do so well? We run an admissions process that I think would be the envy of any highly selective college or university in the world, in terms of the number of eyes that we’re able to put on every candidate, the range of things we’re able to look at, the ways in which we’re able to use information at our disposal. And we run a program that I see as college as it should be. Every scholar goes through a series of escalating challenges and ensures that they have an extraordinary university experience. We have this amazing network, and we have this very powerful brand, particularly in the state of North Carolina, where, if you walk into high schools, you can see signs celebrating Morehead scholars going back to the 1950s. And how do we use those assets, beyond just our financial assets, to maximize our impact? And there are a number of ways in which we can think about these things. So on the first, when we think about the program and the future of the program, one of the things that I hope we will do a little more deliberately in the years ahead is articulate for scholars the outcomes that we hope to see.*

*One of the weaknesses I see in tertiary education is we organize ourselves around the acquisition of credits and majors rather than the articulation of a set of higher order outcomes that are essential for lifelong learning and leadership. And I actually think we have a number of implicit outcomes that we care about. We want to foster explorers. We want to build every scholar with the capacity for personal authorship. We want to help you articulate for yourself a sense of purpose. And we see that as a result of the amazing things our alumni are doing across a whole range of sectors. But I think we would help you manage your own university experience better and help us ensure outcomes for every scholar if we could actually do a better job of articulating what those outcomes that we seek are and how our programmatic investments lead to those outcomes, how can we assess our progress? And so that’s one place where I think we need to get stronger. And I think if we get stronger in that area, we set a model for how the university more broadly could get stronger in this area. And that’s exciting for me, too.*

*Second, when I think of us as a platform, there are low hanging fruit ideas that I think we need to tackle with gusto. I’ve been very aware in 2021 and 2022 that I’m not sure that there has been a worse time to be a school teacher in the United States of America. As I looked at what happened in Uvalde, for example, and I think about and we see the exodus of teachers from the profession. This is a profession that develops leaders for our society, right? How do we play a meaningful role in the lives of educators? And we have extraordinary scholars who know extraordinary educators. And a very low hanging fruit thing for us to do is simply thank extraordinary high school educators for the work they do to prepare leaders every day. And in so doing, I think we can also help those leaders in these classrooms all over North Carolina, all over the United States, and the world understand what Morehead-Cain is, and funnel more extraordinary scholars from all different backgrounds into our program. So starting this year, as you know, we’ve asked every scholar to tell us about a high school educator that shaped our lives. We’re also giving every semifinalist this opportunity, and then we will be giving Morehead-Cain Impact Educator Awards to all of these hundreds of educators across the state, nation, and world who are having impact on young leaders, hopefully creating a sense of celebration and adding some respect and joy to their work in the classroom. But we will also, beginning with educators in North Carolina, give them the opportunity this year to apply for Lovelace Fund Discovery Grants, small amounts of money that they can use to explore things that can help them prepare the next generation of leaders better. But in so doing and communicating this opportunity, we communicate the way in which we think about education at Morehead-Cain and how opportunities like the Discovery Fund can unlock next levels of learning and help people understand what the opportunity at Morehead-Cain and UNC is in more detail. So this is a small thing. I’m grateful to some alumni who have provided the funding for us to undertake this pilot, but it’s an example of us using our platform in a way that hopefully increases our impact on the state, nation, and world, but also has a positive effect on the future of the program by bringing even more extraordinary candidates into Morehead-Cain in the future.*

*And I think there are questions for us to ask about other investments that we could make that could not only enhance that core of scholars in the Morehead-Cain program, but also have a broader beneficial impact on society. And if there are alumni or scholars who are listening to this, and they think, “Hey, I’ve got an idea of something Morehead-Cain might be able to do that could both enhance the core and maximize our impact on the world,” we’d love to hear it.*

(Elias)

*Thank you, Chris. I was really excited to be able to finally thank one of my teachers, and thank you for trying to make college more as it should be, as a place where we’re able to pay back to those who served us.*

*Okay, we started talking about exciting ideas in the future, but we also started this conversation by talking about the importance of understanding our past. How do you think about the purpose of Morehead-Cain in this continuum?*

(Chris)

*One of the inspiring things for me before arriving here was reading the trust indenture that John Motley Morehead III wrote to establish what was then the Morehead Foundation. Because he wrote something that, a statement that I think is timeless. He said, “The most important investment that can be made for a people is that which is made in the education and training as leaders of those who have been endowed by their creator with the capacity for leadership.” And that is what he sought to do with his resources. And many of our alumni will probably recognize that sentence as something that they heard at their Fall Banquets or their Senior Dinner, because it’s something that we have repeated time and again here at the Foundation. And so, why do we exist here at the Foundation? Why did Mary Cain make a gift from the Gordon and Mary Cain Foundation to Morehead and make it Morehead-Cain was because Gordon Cain had made his money through leverage in private equity and believed in the leverage of leadership. So why do we exist? We exist as an organization to develop leaders who shape thriving communities. And we are investors who invest in leaders because of their impact on communities. And as we think about the future of the Foundation, we need to think about, first, how do we develop leaders who can positively impact their communities? But second, how do we use ourselves? And how do we use our resources and these assets to maximize our impact on those communities themselves? The thing about the teacher idea that I just described, for example, is that it’s not a significant departure from what we’ve done. It’s a very inexpensive way, a thing for us to do on our existing platform, to thank people who deserve to be thanked for the role they play in developing leaders and shaping communities. And it also improves our ability to identify leaders who we can develop to shape communities. And I think there are lots of opportunities like this as we think expansively. And I look forward to working with all of you to think about how we invest ourselves, our time, our resources in ways that maximize their impact on this university, on the state of North Carolina, on the United States, and on the world. I think we’ve only scratched the surface of what we are capable of as leaders because leadership is the most important investment that can be made in the future of a society.*

(Elias)

*Thank you. Chris, one of the things I’ve noticed during my time at Morehead-Cain is that everybody emphasizes Morehead-Cain being a center for catalyzing change. In fact, the theme of the Catalyze podcast is action movement and bringing about change. When faced with obstacles, hardships, or challenges, is there a song that you listen to that motivates you to keep you going?*

(Chris)

*This is a great question. Obstacles, hardships, or challenges? Well, when I have to get fired up, or when I have to start a day where there’s a big day, like the Forum day, my hype song. So you will typically find that I’m listening to Curtis Mayfield’s the Super Fly soundtrack or James Brown’s “Get Up.” Those have been songs for me for many, many years. Day to day, going true to my roots in South Africa, I do actually listen to quite a lot of Afrobeats, so Wizkid or Davido, but those are less hype songs for me and more kind of a soundtrack of our house and our life.*

(Elias)

*Chris, is there anything else you would like to add before we close out?*

(Chris)

*The only thing I’d like to add is to repeat something I said before. I learn through conversations with members of this community every day, and my office and inbox are open. I welcome the opportunity to schedule a time with any scholar over the MCN. And I’m grateful, Elias, for your time and for your curiosity and for all of your engagement both here at Morehead-Cain and across the UNC community.*

(Elias)

*And thank you so much for joining the episode today, Chris.*

(Chris)

*It’s been a pleasure.*

## Episode Transcription

*Good morning. I’m Debbie Harden, and I’m a grateful member of the Morehead-Cain class of 1979. Now, I realize many of you were not born then, so let me take you back in time. We were 54 scholars strong, and for the first time, there were female candidates. Twelve of us who were instantly dubbed “the Dirty Dozen” made it through those interviews. But let me tell you, it was also the first time for those Morehead committees to deal with women. And they were primarily older men. And in the back of their mind, each of them, either subtly or directly, through their questions, managed to ask almost all of us, “Are you serious about a degree, about a career? Are you coming to Chapel Hill for an M.R.S.?” And I’ll tell you, my 18-year-old, inexperienced, confident self looked at those older men and said, “I can do both. I can have a demanding career and a family.” Well, unfortunately, they weren’t as wise as they thought, because they didn’t get it that I didn’t quite tell the truth. But I believed it at the time.*

*So jump ahead with me. Fast forward to 2019. The Morehead-Cain Foundation has a gathering of “the Dirty Dozen.” It’s our 40th anniversary and we’re back. And as part of the weekend, we meet with the current scholars in a panel format. Once again, I’m in the halls of the Morehead Building. I’ve always loved that building. And I hear that same question from a young scholar that haunted us so many years before. “Can you really both handle a demanding career and have a family? And if so, please tell us how.” Well, let’s just say with 40 years of experience, I didn’t give that group of scholars the same answer that I had that older group of committee members.*

*So let me just give you a brief glimpse into my past as to what shaped the new answer. I’ve been a practicing lawyer for 40 years. My husband Mark and I are celebrating our 40th anniversary, and we are the proud parents of three children. It has been a fulfilling life, but not always an easy one. For the first ten years of our marriage, we devoted ourselves to building our relationship and our careers. Two very demanding careers. Ten years later, finally, we were fortunate to have our son.*

*And we were ecstatic. And you know what? We kind of figured it out with one child because we, as double Tar Heels, could play man-to-man defense. We understood that, and we could trade off. But 28 months later, we were given premature twins. And all of a sudden our man-to-man defense days were gone. We were in that zone. And all of us Tar Heels know, there’s always a weakness in every zone defense. So what did we do? Well, we had a nanny, but we hired our nanny a part-time sitter, and we backed her up with other helpers. And we committed ourselves to trying to do the best we could with our very young family.*

*So finally, I returned to work. I’ve been a partner now for a few years, and it’s my first trial after having the twins. Come with me to this federal courthouse. Imagine you’re sitting in the courtroom, you’re finally back. I’ve landed a new client. I’ve got the general counsel beside me. I’ve got the chairman of the board in the witness stand, and I’ve got the CEO coming up next. I am back. I got this. I can live up to that 1975 promise.*

*And all of a sudden, from the back of the room, a note is passed to me, and I open it, and that note says, “Nanny’s sick. Can’t take care of children. Need help.” So what are you going to do? Once again, we have planned, we have tried, we have backed ourselves up. But that’s a difficult choice for a young mom. As the lawyers in this auditorium know, in the middle of the trial, the lead trial counsel’s greatest gift is confidence from the client. What are you going to do? You’re going to sit there and tell your client that you’re going to walk out the door? But as a young parent, are you going to leave your kids without proper care? So it’s with those types of experiences that I answer the question in 2019 in the Morehead halls. And my answer this time is not “definitely,” it’s “maybe.”*

*But you’re going to have to have three things if you’re both going to try to manage a demanding career and have a family. Number one, know there’s going to be sacrifices. Sacrifices by you and by your spouse and sometimes, unfortunately, by your children. Secondly, you have to have support. And for me, my most important support came in the form of my spouse who wanted to be an active part of his children’s life, and who, more importantly, supported my decision and my choice to try to have it all. And third is support from your firm, your career, your partners. You cannot do it alone. Don’t try. But the most difficult thing is the compromise you have to realize and accept for yourself. Each of us in this room, I bet, share a sense of being the best. You must or you are not satisfied. But let me tell you, you cannot be the best every moment of every day in what you do. You have to accept something less than the best. And in the words of one of my best friends and my law partners: You’ve got to learn, don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.*

*Thank you.*

Former congressman David Price ’61 joined Catalyze with scholar co-hosts Benny Klein ’24 and Elias Guedira ’26 in December 2022 during the politician’s final month in office. Price, who retired this January, represented North Carolina’s fourth district, including Orange County, Chapel Hill.

The alumnus visited the Foundation to share about his lifetime career of public service and his over three decades serving in the U.S. House of Representatives. Price also spoke about his involvement as a scholar in the civil rights movement at UNC–Chapel Hill, some of his proudest political accomplishments, and his post-retirement plans.

[Listen to the episode](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/david-price-61-retires-from-congress-after-more-than-three-decades-of-service-to-north-carolinas-fourth-district).

Price released the fourth edition of his book, The Congressional Experience, in 2020. He revised the book to cover the Obama and Trump administrations.

After receiving his bachelor’s degree at Carolina, he pursued graduate studies at Yale University to earn a theology degree (1964) and a PhD in political science (1969). Price is a professor of political science at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy.

## Episode Transcription

(Benny)

*Congressman Price, thank you so much for joining Catalyze with me and co-host, Elias. I appreciate you being here.*

(David)

*Glad to be here.*

(Benny)

*You and I had the chance to chat a few weeks ago at a panel event with Rabbi Greyber in Durham. I’m glad it could work out that you could be with us here today. How does it feel to have less than a month now left in Congress?*

(David)

*I hardly have time to think about it. I am in the middle of a lame-duck session, which I hope will take most of the month; when I say I hope it will, not because I want to sit up there and wait for votes, necessarily, but I do want us to finish our budget for fiscal year 2023. So if we’re there till Christmas Eve or whenever it is, that will be a sign that that’s getting done. So I’m ready for that. But January 3 is the date. That’s when my term ends and when the new Congress comes in.*

(Elias)

*How are you splitting your time between Chapel Hill and Washington, D.C., for this last month? I’m* *guessing that you don’t like to take the train to D.C. like President Biden, so what does your typical journey look like?*

(David)

*Well, this last month is fairly atypical because I’m in Washington so much. I mean, we are in session every week trying to get this lame-duck session through. It’s the main thing is the budget for next year, but also an important defense authorization and the Defense of Marriage Act, which passed this past week, and so on, lots of things. But normally, I divide my time about half and half. Our schedule is three weeks on, one week off, so to speak, and then a longer recess in the summer. But I’m home every weekend. We never set up housekeeping in Washington. My wife used to say that we still live like graduate students up there after 30 years. I have a small efficiency apartment, but that’s the way I like it. I’m on that plane back here after every vote, and the whole job is defined by that division. I often say that to people. It’s like nothing else I know of, where you have a district job and you have a D.C. job. And, of course, you try to relate the two in constructive ways, but if you tilt in one direction or the other, you’re probably in trouble. If you go Washington and don’t remember the home district, or if you become totally parochial and don’t think about trying to make a mark in Washington, neither of those is a good thing. You need to keep that district orientation and your D.C. focus in some kind of balance.*

(Elias)

*It’s so good that you’re able to spend time back in Chapel Hill and enjoying North Carolina weather and seeing your family.*

(Benny)

*Sure, and you started your college career at Mars Hill College in North Carolina. What was the process like, transferring to North Carolina and becoming a Morehead-Cain Scholar?*

(David)

*Well, I feel very fortunate that there was a process in the first place, and that when I think about my interview, I rode a bus. My first visit to Chapel Hill was riding a bus eight hours from Mars Hill to Chapel Hill and then sitting the next day for an interview. And I think back about that interview; I wonder, how in the world did I ever get this fellowship? But I did, and that changed my life. I mean, it was a very, very important occasion in my life. I was headed probably . . . I’m a Tennessee native. I’d come 30 miles across the mountain to Mars Hill to college. I was going to transfer somewhere. It was a junior college in those years, probably University of Tennessee, but the Morehead scholarship changed all that. And I came in this direction, and I came in this direction at a very momentous time. The Civil Rights Movement was sweeping through our region. There was great excitement on and off campus here. Those were two very exciting and very formative years. And in my case, I came from a very small town. Those two years at Mars Hill were important, kind of nurturing, maturing years. But I was really to take full advantage of UNC as a junior. And back then, they gave Morehead scholarships to transferring juniors. Each junior college was able to nominate two people, and fortunately, Mars Hill nominated me.*

(Benny)

*That’s great.*

(Elias)

*You talk about the Morehead scholarship being a life-changing experience and being able to benefit fully from college. Do you have a favorite summer enrichment story or memory that has involvement with Morehead-Cain that really sticks with you?*

(David)

*Well, there were no summer enrichment components to the program back then, and I’m not sure what I did that the summers would have qualified, but they nonetheless were important experiences for me. One summer, I drove a dry cleaning truck. I also had a summer working in a warehouse at a nuclear fuels plant. I, all through college, had a list of clients. I mowed their yards every week. So these weren’t Morehead-type experiences, but they were nonetheless very formative experiences. A couple of things I did were more in the Morehead line, I guess. As a Carolina student leader, I was able to go to the National Training Laboratories in Bethel, Maine and have two weeks of just incredible experiences with what we then called T groups. It’s kind of a technique that Jerry Bell, here in the business school, has refined, techniques in leadership and in seeing yourself as others see you.*

*Also, because I was going to be president of the Baptist Student Union—I was not a Baptist, but I nonetheless was going to be president of the Baptist Student Union—I had a semester at Southeastern Seminary in Wake Forest, which was then a progressive Baptist seminary that also was formative. So many, many summer experiences. I think the enrichment programs, of course, for Morehead-Cain are an important addition to the program, but I was kind of on my own in figuring out what I did each summer.*

(Benny)

*Yes, sir. I think during your time at Carolina, you were integral. You mentioned the civil rights movement and things that were going on at that time. You mentioned helping to integrate campus restaurants. Was that part of your early politicization?*

(David)

*Yes, absolutely. It was probably the most important part. When people ask me how did I get to Congress, I would tend to go back to those years, not to my first campaign, really, because I came from a perfectly good, nurturing, small-town background. But there was a lot that was going on in this country that I didn’t know about, even at Mars Hill, I didn’t. But it hit me here on this campus and in this community. My kids grew up here, and they have a hard time believing that Chapel Hill was as insular and as conservative a community as it was in those years. But there was one restaurant in the entire town that served people on an equal basis. That was the Rathskeller, the famous Rathskeller, but the others didn’t. The theaters were segregated and so on. So it was an interesting interfaith experience. I did have a Mars Hill cabal that got me elected president of the Baptist Student Union, and it was the religious groups on campus that took the lead in picketing the theaters and the restaurants. And so did Hillel and so did The Newman Center. So it was my first interfaith experience, as well as a kind of test of the values I had grown up with.*

*We were figuring out in those times that, yes, the Hebrew prophets are in the Bible, and they do have something to say to modern times. And the faith that we profess is not just about individual morality. It’s about the kind of society that we want to live in and that we value. And so there is that social gospel that we need to come to terms with. So my religious views were certainly shaped by this. So were my political views. I had grown up a fairly conventional Republican in East Tennessee, just not thinking much about it. My social views, I look back to that period as a time when in the classroom and outside the classroom, I did a lot of thinking, a lot of maturing, and I came out of it with some convictions about politics and about government. I don’t think after that I was ever going to be taking cheap shots at government. I mean, I knew government could do badly or well, but I also knew that the kind of social change that this country needed and that we were working for required politics and government, and I never forgot that.*

(Benny)

*And I know you attended Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I had a Dream” speech on the National Mall, and you witnessed the passing of the Civil Rights Act from the Senate gallery. So keeping in that same vein of early social action and change, could you talk a little bit about those moments?*

(David)

*Well, I went from Carolina to Yale Divinity School for what at first was called a trial year. It’s a subsidized indecision. I had a year to consider the ministry. I decided I would not be in the ministry, but I also decided I was getting a very good liberal arts education. So I stayed at Yale Divinity School for the three-year degree, and then I went into the PhD program in political science. All through that period, I did have a summer deal. I kind of walked in and was hired off the street by a senator from Alaska named Bob Bartlett. And that was in the summer of ’63. And so I went back to that office every summer for five years. I was basically a legislative aide who would come in in the summer and relieve other people and sometimes go to Alaska. And it was the second of those summers, summer of ’64, when the Civil Rights Act of ’64 was passed. And it was also the first of those summers, ’63, when The March on Washington occurred. I was a peripheral participant in that. I was totally sympathetic, but I was a staff member on my lunch hour, essentially, and my friends and I went as close as we could get into the crowd there and took great inspiration from it.*

*That passage of The Civil Rights Act in ’64, and mind you, this was three years, three years after we were picketing the Varsity Theater in Chapel Hill. And how often do things happen that fast? It really was a movement that swept the country, and it pricked our conscience collectively, and that showed how politics and government could work. So I was crowded into that Senate gallery to see the key vote on The Civil Rights Bill, and I remember a senator who was near death being brought in on a stretcher to cast that vote. It was just a very, very memorable scene.*

(Elias)

*Thank you so much for sharing that memory with us. What other advice do you have for scholars who are interested in working in politics, and what have been truths that you have depended on to get through the hard times?*

(David)

*Well, I guess my advice does stem from the story I just told in the sense that the basic question is not: are you going to have this or that political career? The basic question is: what are you going to do as a citizen, and how do you view your citizenship? Citizenship in a democracy requires active engagement. Not everybody needs to run for Congress, but everybody needs to be informed. I mean, Thomas Jefferson said this a long time ago about democracy. People need to be informed. They need to be conversant with the issues of the day. They need to be conversant with each other and with the sentiments in the community, and need to participate in the democratic mechanisms for translating needs and wants and interests and values—translating those things into advocacy and into public policy. So, at some level, it is important to be involved. In my case, I did have in the back of my mind, wouldn’t it be wonderful to be in Congress someday? I guess the way I was brought up, public service was about the best there was.*

*But when I came down here for that Morehead interview, or even when I came here then some years later to take the job over across the way at Duke University, my first teaching job, if you said, “In twelve years, you’re going to represent this district in Congress,” I would have thought that was preposterous.*

*But that is what happened, and it’s, of course, a dream come true for me. But the foundations were really laid here on this campus and in this community in the early ’60s, when I figured out that for rest of my life, I had better be attentive to politics. And so, after that, I did find ways to get involved at the precinct level in various ways, and I served on various staffs in the Senate and in campaigns, and one thing led to another, and ’84 came along. That was the race of the century, as far as we were concerned. I was recruited to come and chair the State Democratic Party full-time. I took a leave of absence from Duke to do that at Jim Hunt’s request. This was the Hunt versus Helm Senate race. It was a blockbuster. It was totally, totally devastating to lose that race and to lose the governorship, to lose three Congressional seats at the same time. We picked ourselves up collectively, and I decided, jeez, maybe I can do about as well as some of these folks I’ve been trying to help. So I ran myself and managed to win that Congressional seat a mere two years later.*

*And by the way, Terry Sanford got elected to the Senate two years later. Every sense in our pep talks we give, we always talk about that. Two years after the most devastating defeat you could imagine, we had this comeback. And that’s, of course, the way politics sometimes is.*

(Benny)

*I want to ask about the role of media and the changing role of media in your career. I’ve heard you speak before, and I hope you’ll allow me to paraphrase about one of your early races where you thought that in-person interviews and conversations were going to be the difference maker in the vote, and instead, it was big TV ads, once you finally had the budget to be able to do those. Now things are changed a little bit, and you have Congressmen with millions of followers on TikTok. Can you talk about that change a little bit?*

(David)

*That certainly is a change, and it wasn’t in my case, it wasn’t big TV ads. It was little TV ads. It was home movies almost. My media guy would hate to hear me say this, but I’d campaigned in the traditional style, every church supper, every gathering I could find. I was at it for a year, and I’d been State Party Chairman, for goodness sake. Who knew? It turned out my name recognition after a year of that kind of campaigning was around 10 percent. So we did scrape enough money together to run some very modest TV ads, me, straight into the camera—this was after Hunt-Helms, so it was a resonant theme—“We’ve got to clean up politics in this state. We got to do better.” In two weeks’ time, my name recognition tripled, and I managed to win the primary. That was hard, though. That was really difficult. We also were talking about the changes in media and the difference that made because we were in this transition period. Jesse Helms, for better or for worse, had pioneered the use of these fire-breathing TV ads, and they were usually negative, and they often just tapped into pretty base sentiments, but they did work.*

*And so we all had to figure out how to compete in that environment, and we did. I wrote all this up in my book. I talk about how that environment got more and more toxic, and the antidotes that we would use. The kind of counter ads that we would run had to get more and more pointed in order to do the job because it was—you could just see how the atmosphere was—becoming much more difficult, in terms of conventional campaigning where you present yourself and your platform. That didn’t do it anymore.*

*Of course, social media is a whole new realm, and I’m sort of innocent of the techniques of social media personally, but my office is not. I mean, we’re out there every day with press releases, but also with postings on Twitter and Facebook and all the social media platforms, and we go back and forth on that. We try to do it in a decent and respectful way, but there’s no question that you got to be there. It’s also no question that there are some huge problems here. I’ll just mention two.*

*One is the disinformation and the defamatory stuff. It becomes very hard to control. Or the question is, should you try to control it? Should there be some kind of regulatory framework for controlling this? Because it is virulent and it is very pervasive.*

*The second thing is that it has become increasingly tempting, I think, to come into Congress or to come into other public institutions as almost a creature of social media. I write in my book about what a change it was from the politics of campaigning to the politics of finding a niche in Congress and trying to become a policymaker. I think a lot of people don’t even experience that transition now. They come into Congress, and they’re still mainly focused on social media. That doesn’t make for a very effective legislator. Legislation is the realm of learning from other people, figuring out the ropes in the institution, learning what your institutional responsibilities are, not just your personal media following, but how do you function in an institutional environment. I’m not saying it’s not responsible. It is responsible. I think it is actually an aspect of morality, of the morality of public service, is to make an institution work, not just to maintain your purity in the eyes of your constituents.*

*That’s a big problem because we have way too many people in Congress right now who never have successfully focused internally on making the institution work. And you can see it at a time like this lame-duck session. Why are we up there? Why are we up there three months into the fiscal year, messing around, hoping we can get a budget? Well, we don’t have quite the team play that we should have.*

(Benny)

*I’ve always been really curious about—as we talk about polarization and the lack of civic discourse in America that I think is hurt by—social media and the extremes that it helps promote. For me personally, as a Jewish American who just came back from Israel, seeing Kanye West and others get brought up to a massive platform to spread hate, that’s the sentiment that I feel, and it makes me nervous. So from your position, what are those conversations like in Congress? Does that hate inspire what we see on social media from maybe some of the more fringe candidates? Is it civil? What are your conversations like across the aisle?*

(David)

*Well, so far, I’ve not seen overt antisemitism on the floor of the House of Representatives. I’m not saying with some of these characters that it couldn’t occur. But there is a kind of constraint that most people observe, and more cordiality among individual members than you might think, judging from what you see on C-SPAN or see on social media. Having said that, there are these currents of hate and bigotry abroad in our country, and they were given, I think, some legitimacy. Worldwide, these are trends that we see, political extremism, which often has just . . . do people have no idea of the history of antisemitism and the kind of last century that we endured? I mean, it’s just incredible, the kind of ignorance and bigotry that goes into this, and the kind of, sometimes, our inability in our democracy to deal with this effectively. You have to assume that the majority of the people, at some point, will understand the limits and will bring us back toward a more modern and more mainstream way of operating.*

*I’m rambling because there isn’t an easy answer to this, but it’s something you observe in our country and around the world. I’ve been working with democracies through our House Democracy Partnership. That’s probably the last half of my congressional career. That’s been my main contribution, is to set up a bipartisan commission that works with emerging democracies. I’m not going to tell you what the scorecard is right now because the scorecard is not good. Democracy and the kind of rules of the game that we respect in democracy. The declines are more conspicuous right now than the advances, although there, fortunately, are some advances.*

(Elias)

*Congressman Price, I’ve noticed how we’ve been talking recently about changes in U.S. Congress, specifically how we’ve witnessed a massive change in politicians being elected to their platforms. You speak about a time when individuals first became congressmen, and then occupying a niche in Congress, shifting to a time when congressmen and other politicians are kind of forced to uphold a social media image and maintain a powerful presence on social media. In your fourth edition of the book, The Congressional Experience, you put a historical context on the events witnessed over the past two administrations. You did this specifically by drawing comparisons between major events observed during the Clinton and Bush administrations. What is one notable comparison that you touched on in this book and would you like to elaborate on it?*

(David)

*The main change in terms of the atmospherics of American politics, just to rephrase your question a bit, probably did have to do with the advent of Trump and the legitimation of, I would say, anti-constitutional ways of operating and certainly outside the norms of politics ways of operating that he brought with him. I didn’t include the Insurrection. The book was finished in mid-2020, so I had no idea how much worse it could get. But I do think I had Trump pretty well figured out, and I revised a lot of what I had said.*

*This earlier thing about this earlier matter we were discussing about how do you view yourself as a part of an institution. I did revise those earlier discussions to say, that needs to include, by the way, defense of the U.S. Constitution. It needs to include defense of the basic freedoms that we enjoy and the kind of respect that we expect for each other. And these are things that I didn’t earlier think I needed to say, I guess. We’re not out of the woods yet as a democracy. This Supreme Court case that North Carolina brought, making the state legislatures supreme. Goodness, that was a fringe theory. Now they’re actually considering it. We’re not out of the woods in matters of democratic, but I do think we’re more self-aware, and we’re more aware of the vulnerabilities that we as a country ourselves, we’re exposed in ways that we didn’t think possible.*

(Benny)

*Congressman, some of your recent successes include the $40 million Choice Neighborhoods Grant for Durham, the passing of the Joint Consolidation Loan Separation Act, which I know you’re really proud of. What are some of the other things that, as you wrap up the Congressional career, are on your mind for the future?*

(David)

*Well, I don’t think we’ll ever top the nine-year effort to build the Environmental Protection Agency Lab out in the Research Triangle Park. That was a major, major effort. Along the lines of more recent awards, we’re on our way now, I think, to having a southeast rail corridor that you talked about, how I wouldn’t take the train to Washington. Well, I think in another decade, my successor might take the train to Washington because we have great Raleigh to Charlotte train service. Nobody ought to drive to Charlotte these days. No reason. Connecting that next corridor, Raleigh to Richmond, is the key to having a southeast corridor that works. And one of my signature issues as Transportation and Housing Appropriations Chairman has been to get money in that account for developing passenger rail. Fortunately, North Carolina and Virginia have benefited big time from that, so I’m proud of those things.*

*I am also proud and protective of the democracy promotion work that we’ve done through the House Democracy Partnership. These are developing countries that have many, many courageous people that we just have to admire, but we also have to support, as they attempt to establish parliamentary democracies. And I don’t know, if we don’t do it, I’m not sure who will. I think many of these countries are fragile, and so the parliamentary support we give them is critically important.*

(Elias)

*Congressman Price, you’ve had a political career spanning close to 60 years, covering seven administrations, from serving as an aide after college to serving throughout seven presidential administrations in U.S. Congress. As you have served in political office for the majority of your life, many of your constituents may be asking, “What’s next?” What can we expect from this next chapter of your life?*

(David)

*Well, I have been there a while, and it is time to go. At this point, I go with some reluctance. It’s a big change. But I’m going to return to the Public Policy School at Duke University, which I helped start some number of years ago. I’m going to do a lecture here on the Carolina campus, the Lambeth Lecture, in early February. So stay involved.*

(Benny)

*Sounds like we need to get on the waitlist for that.*

(David)

*Well, I’m looking forward to that and looking forward to being involved with the Morehead-Cain program and other ways that I will be here more and able more to pitch in. And I will do, I’m sure, some guest appearances here and there. And I hope also to keep involved internationally with, say, the National Democratic Institute, in some of this parliamentary work. So I’m not quite sure how it’s going to sort out, but I have been invited to take a fellowship at the Sanford School, and so that’s what I’ll be doing.*

(Elias)

*Wonderful. Thank you so much for spending time with us today.*

(Benny)

*Yes, thank you, Congressman. We really appreciate it.*

(David)

*Great to talk to both of you.*

## Episode Transcription

*So since we’ve got the same uncle and we’re cousins, we can have a little family talk, right? I named my first company Primo, and primo is a double entendre in black urban culture. Primo means top shelf crème de la crème, if you will. But in Spanish, primo is cousins. So we’re primos, you are my Morehead primos. We have a similar DNA, and with that, we run on the same operating system, if you will. Like Apple products run on Mac OS, but without the a, MC OS in all operating systems, they need updates and upgrades, right? Like this triennial is a major system upgrade. I mean, the conversations we have, the ideas that are shared are second to none. So I want to give you some other ways that you can make sure you stay MC OS optimized between now and our next triennial. So, first thing’s first: big annual reboots. Think about it. This is in the very fabric of our program and how it’s designed. Think about how impactful your summer experience was on you and your perspective. I argue you need this every single year.*

*So several years ago, I got a 40 Under 40 award, and with that came this scholarship to attend the John Grinnell Executive Leadership Jumpstart Program in Wilmington. So it was like a $10,000 scholarship, right? And as a young professional, I would have never invested in my reboot at that time, but boy, this experience was next level. I mean, not only did it allow me to put the phone to the side and unplug from technology for a week or so, which I needed, it also really helped me with self-awareness and learning more about my professional strengths and some of my blind spots. And most importantly, it really, through kind of hypnosis and coaching and therapy, tapped into my subconscious and helped me learn about some of those false negative and limiting beliefs that were holding me down. I mean, this was an impact amplifier for me. So much so, I’ve sent, on my own dime, ten people from my organization through this program. And there are countless programs like this that’s just waiting on you to plug into it. I mean, Outward Bound has a professional series that I’ve done, and one of my favorites right now, it’s a little vacation and some development and rejuvenation. It’s called Rancho La Puerta. It’s in Tacate, Mexico. And this is like an alternative wellness and learning retreat.*

*So pick your flavor, no pun intended from the ice cream guy, but big annual reboot is a must. All right, app number two that you need to download on your MC OS is what I call tours of duty. This is inspired by a book called The Alliance, written by one of the cofounders of LinkedIn, and it talks about the work and endeavors we have. It’s kind of like tours of duty, like the military almost, right? And there are three different kinds of tours of duty. You’ve got transitional tours of duty. These are kind of like stop gaps. Like, normally six to twelve months transitioning. Then you’ve got transformational tours of duty, just like they sound. This is a tour that you’re supposed to be transformed and you’re supposed to transform something about the endeavor that you’re working on. These are normally three to five years in time. And then the final tour of duty is called a foundational tour of duty. This is kind of like a marriage, right? Like at the core, we’re connected. I am the endeavor. The endeavor is me. And so why is this important for Morehead-Cain? Well, the other side of this passion sword that we carry around is that you guys can get really dialed into about any and everything sometimes.*

*And it’s important that you know what kind of tour you’re embarking on. You don’t want to take a transitional tour and just carry it on and on and on because of your passion, right? You don’t want to bring transformational energy to transitional endeavors. So I’d ask the room, think about one of your main endeavors right now. What kind of tour of duty is it? Is it a transitional tour that maybe it’s time to graduate up from, or is it a transformational tour? And if it’s a transformational tour, where are you on the tour right now? Are you on the first leg? Are you in the middle or toward the end? If you’re in the middle or toward the end, I’d encourage you to start talking about and having some conversations about what’s my next tour, what’s my next tour of duty as I complete this one.*

*So my third and final app for Morehead-Cain OS optimization. This one is kind of like a suite of tools like Microsoft Office and you’ve got Excel and Word. And so this is a suite of tools. You’ve got SAVERS, Pyramid of Mastery, and PQ. We’ll walk you through each three of these tools.*

*SAVERS, it’s a routine. It’s a morning routine that as many days as you can start your day like this. It’s great. It plugs in perfectly with Morehead-Cain. It’s an acronym: Silence Affirmations Visualizations Exercise Reading and Scribing. Now, the reason this is so good with MC OS is because it’s flexible like you. Can do a five minute SAVER routine, or you can go mega-zen like I do. Sometimes I go five hours, right? But it’s very flexible. Google it, look it up, and see if it fits with what you’re doing. It’s highly compatible with MC OS.*

*The next one is called the Pyramid of Mastery. And this is world-renowned author and motivational speaker Tony Robbins’s best brainchild, if you ask me. The Pyramid of Mastery, it talks about these seven areas of our life that we’re in constant pursuit of mastery and balance in. It’s kind of shaped like a pyramid, right? And so you’ve got physiology, emotions, relationships, time, work. Finance is separate and then contribution, and they’re really connected. Like, I can’t be the best that I can be emotionally if I’m not physically feeling well. It’s hard to do. In order for me to show up as a leader, I need to be in my personal and professional relationships.*

*I need to be pretty straight, emotionally myself. In order for me to truly be a master at time management, I can’t have relationships that waste a lot of my time, right. And I tend to do pretty good at work whenever I’m using my time wisely. And when I do good at work, my finances grow, and I’m able to contribute in major ways to my church and Morehead and things that I’m passionate about. So this for me is like every 90 days, every quarter, like, mirror that I self-reflect in. And so this is the Pyramid of Mastery.*

*And so the last of these tools that I share with you today is something called PQ, or Positive intelligence. So this is based on the research and book by an author named Shirzad. And it really talks about your brain and your mind and positive intelligence, kind of like you’ve got these two areas of your brain. You’ve got the saboteur region and the sage region, okay? The saboteur region is kind of your fear area. It’s your reptilian brain, where characteristics like being controlling. Like, not that anybody in this room knows anything about that, right? But if you did, being controlling is back here in the saboteur region, or being a stickler or, the most common one, being judgmental. It says we spend so much time not even consciously doing it, but judging ourselves, judging others, judging circumstances, right? So all that’s here in the saboteur.*

*Now, the sage region is where positive characteristics like creativity and empathy and innovation live. And if you imagine being in a gym and for years, day after day, you just lift with one arm over and over and maybe you do something here every 90, but you do this like every day. That’s your gym routine at some point, like, you get really weak and you get really strong, innocent imbalance. And so PQ is an actual app on your phone. It’s like a six week basic training boot camp for your mind and your mental fitness, and it helps you become more aware of this saboteur behavior so you can turn it off and stop building that muscle and really build this sage region up. And so I’ll give you ways, like, I finished the boot camp several years ago, but I still use some of these tactics in my training right now.*

*One of the things I do, I find myself in conundrums quite often, right, as an entrepreneur business person, getting into sticky situations. And what I do is I consult with my elder wiser self. Literally, I’ve got a meditation room at my house here. My wife, she’s very mad about me taking a whole room just for meditation. I’ve got a meditation room in my house, and I go in there, and I talk with my elder, wiser self. What would Antonio 20 years from now say about this conundrum? And here’s, I think, the best one I do, and it’s really good for Morehead-Cain because we can be really hard on ourselves. We can really be hard on ourselves. And the other one I do is I love myself. Like, literally, I get a picture of some time when you were a child, sometime before the age of ten, and, like, spend some time loving that picture, loving that child, looking at that child, and appreciating the curiosity and the creativity of that child, because that child is you. And so, in closing, it should be clear I’m a super advocate for strengths-based leadership as Morehead-Cain primos.*

*Our key strength is our passion. So I want you to cultivate it with habits like PQ and SAVERS. I want you to protect it with tours of duty, and I want you to upgrade it every freaking year, because, you have to forgive me for my passion, but Morehead-Cain is a foundational tour of duty for me. And you being your best self is directly connected with my legacy. As our president Chris often champions, Ubuntu is a South African proverb. I am who I am because you are who you are. So Ubuntu, thank you, and may God bless each and every one of you.*

## Episode transcription

(Elias)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Elias Guedira, from the class of 2026.*

(Stella)

*And I’m Stella Smolowitz from the class of 2026.*

(Elias)

*Joining us today is Steven Aldrich from the class of ’91. Steven currently serves on the board of multiple accounting and software companies in the Bay Area of California. In 2018, he became chair of Oakland Roots Sports Club, a new community-focused pro soccer team based out of Oakland, California.*

(Stella)

*Additionally, Steven spent seven years at GoDaddy, the world’s largest domain registerer that empowers entrepreneurs to succeed online. He served as Chief Product Officer for the last three years, where he helped triple the company’s revenue and exponentially increased the number of customers. In his spare time, he also enjoys foil fencing and goalkeeping.*

(Elias)

*We have the privilege of talking to Steven during the coffee chat for our Sports Affinity Group Alumni meeting this morning, hosted at the Morehead-Cain Foundation. Thank you for joining the pod today, Steven.*

(Steven)

*Delighted to be here, and thanks for inviting me. It’s really exciting to be back on campus and have a chance to talk with you all.*

(Elias)

*I saw you came back in from lunch today at Roots. What was your order there?*

(Steven)

*A: What a great brand. I have to just put off the top there. Roots and Roots recognized game. I had the Roots Bowl just because the brand was there, and it was spectacular. A little bit of chicken on the side, took out the red onion. Great salad. Highly recommended.*

(Elias)

*Nice. What other spots have you visited since being back in Chapel Hill so far?*

(Steven)

*So I made a quick stop at Johnny T-shirt. So I went to go look for Carolina gear with a friend of mine, and that’s about it. I got in late last night, so it really was a short trip in. I’ll get to see my parents this weekend, which is nice. They still live here in Chapel Hill. My dad’s still a professor here at Carolina, so a plug for his freshman seminar. And after Carolina wins today, we’ll see the other parts of the town I get to go visit.*

(Elias)

*Can you briefly tell me what this is, the freshman seminar that your dad teaches, because I believe that I have a friend in my class who’s also taking that class.*

(Steven)

*Sure. And it’s amazing to see my dad, who’s been at Carolina since 1982, still loves going into the classroom every day, and he teaches a freshman seminar. I think the title is, like, The McDonaldization of America. And the basic idea is we take a lot of things for granted. We walk into Starbucks, walk into McDonald’s, and you could go almost anywhere in the world, and it’s the same. And he asks the students to think about that. It’s got some positives, but what are the costs of that standardization and routinization of life. And it’s a thought provoking question, like, “When should you standardize something, and when do you need creativity and artisanal creation?”*

(Stella)

*Yeah, that’s awesome. That is such a really impactful seminar that I think is really needed in our world today to teach about modernization, but also the pros and cons of it.*

(Steven)

*Yeah, thanks. I think he appreciates the students coming in with an open mind, and he loves to hear them both ask questions and then hopefully have them leave the class with an appreciation for what we’re gaining but what we’re giving up with the way the world is moving.*

(Stella)

*Awesome.*

(Elias)

*Sounds like such an interesting seminar. Steven, you currently serve as a board chair for the Oakland Roots Sports Club in Oakland. Can you elaborate for listeners what the mission of this team is? And I’m also a little bit curious about what drew you to the formation of this soccer team in particular.*

(Steven)

*Yeah, those two questions are interlinked. What drew me when I got, literally, a cold email on LinkedIn saying, “Hey, Steven, there’s this idea to bring a purpose-driven pro sports club to Oakland.” I was like, “Great, tell me more.” And they said, “Well, we think this idea of the power of sport combined with the magic of Oakland to impact positive social change.” Like, that was what they talked about from day one, and it brought three strands of my background together. Stella, you talked about my time as an entrepreneur serving small businesses at GoDaddy, and even before that, I was at a company called Intuit, working on their small business product line. I played soccer growing up. Our son had played soccer. I was an athlete here at Carolina. You mentioned foil fencing. I was a fencer for four years with Coach Miller, which is an amazing experience we can talk about later. And then I’d done some work in the nonprofit sector, both in education, but primarily the arts. And so when this note came in and got me so excited, I was like, “Wow, I can bring sport and entrepreneurship and social impact together.” And it just seemed ready-made for me to basically take the first 40-plus years of my life and bring them together in one thing.*

(Elias)

*It’s so cool seeing how all of your interests are able to kind of balance out into this career, and you use your unique aspects in order to create something positive and empower social good. And I kind of wanted to talk a little bit about how you mentioned that this sports team seeks to harness the magic of Oakland. Could you elaborate what exactly that means and what that looks like on a day-to-day basis? For example, you talk about amplifying voices of the community on your website. How does it seek to really shape the identity of Oakland?*

(Steven)

*Yeah, the really interesting thing about this idea of the magic of Oakland is that there’s a history in the town of activism and impact. So the Black Panther movement was started there. You had incredible feminist leaders in the town. You had athletes who came out of the town and created platforms with their voices. You had the labor movement and unionization coming out of Oakland. And so you have this, literally, decades and decades-long set of social impact work, and then you had artists and musicians coming out of the town. And so, when we thought about the magic of Oakland, and we looked at the current state of the city, and it’s roughly a quarter of the population is white, a quarter of the population is black, a quarter of the population is Latinx Square, a quarter of the population is Asian. It’s not exactly that, but it’s pretty close. And then you looked at the geographic split between North, East, West Oakland, and we thought, “Gosh, there should be positive stories about the benefits of the innovation and creativity and grit of the town to balance some of the negative stories that come out about Oakland.” And so when we think about amplifying the voices, we go out, and we find parts of Oakland.*

*There’s a walking tour of West Oakland, and you get to see where moments in history happened and how gentrification in parts of the town also cut off parts of Black Oakland from the rest of Oakland with a highway and how that impacted people growing up there at the time. We think about trying to bring youth sports up to the level of par that you’d like to see in all neighborhoods in the town. And there’s, again, unequal access to playing fields and coaches. So we’ve done some work with a group called Coaching Corps to train 100-plus coaches in our training facility to get them back out into the community. And so we try to turn the spotlight on folks in Oakland who are already doing work on the ground and use our platform. So one of the beautiful things pro sports teams have is people following us, whether it’s on game day or social media channels after the fact. And so we use that visibility for us to shine the spotlight on folks already doing great work in Oakland.*

(Elias)

*That sounds wonderful, Steven.*

(Stella)

*Yeah, and I think one of the really important things that you talk about is that you do use Oakland as a platform for the common good and social change. And one of the things we found while researching for this podcast and on your website was that you guys, Oakland Roots was the first U.S. Soccer team to join Common Goal. And we saw that that was kind of a way to impact social change. So do you think you could elaborate more on what Common Goal is and what’s the impact of partnering with it?*

(Steven)

*Yeah, absolutely, Stella. Common Goal is a really interesting organization. It’s basically a group of very well known soccer players around the world: Juan Mata, Megan Rapinoe, and since then, literally, dozens and dozens of others have said, “Hey, we’re going to pledge 1% of our salaries toward social causes.” And teams can do the same thing, but very few teams had, and no teams in North America had, and still, we were the only team in North America who said, “Hey, we’ll give 1% of our revenues from ticket sales to social impact organizations on the ground.” And we went to Common Goal to say we wanted to do this. They asked, “Well, what would you like to direct those funds toward?” And we said, “An antiracist project.” And at the time, there was not an antiracist project or program within the Common Goal programs that they supported. And we said, “All right, well, let’s catalyze one, let’s take our revenue and our team’s understanding of that very complicated issue, both in society at large, but also in Oakland.” And this was just after the spring of 2020 when, not only do we have COVID going on, but we had George Floyd murdered. And so the topic of race in America was a very important issue and had been brought to the surface where, for a long time, it was kind of under the surface. And so we thought it was important to say, “Let’s focus on antiracism and narrow it down to antiracism around soccer.” And we put some capital towards that, an idea towards a training program that you can take coaches for all levels, front office staff for professional teams, and make sure that those types of programs now touch everyone from the highest level of pro teams down to the local youth soccer level. And that’s been just a home run. So we talked to Common Goal, we got it up and running. Then Angel City in the NWSL joined Chicago Fire, and the MLS joined the American Outlaws—which is the group that follows the U.S. men’s and women’s national teams—joined, and I think there may be one or two other teams that have come on board. Then when that got running, it got catalyzed into something called Switch the Pitch. And so now there’s a program, you can actually go online, download the content, use it with your local clubs, and we’re excited to see that now roll out across the U.S., and eventually, hopefully, the globe.*

(Elias)

*I wanted to ask a little bit more about the impact that COVID and George Floyd really had on this project, specifically regarding the fact that you joined the board of this organization back in 2019. Did you encounter any obstacles during this time or personal challenges that made it difficult or interfered with your work, and how did your work pivot?*

(Steven)

*Yeah, it was a really difficult time. Again, the country as a whole in 2020 goes into lockdown. Any live event, sports included, went into lockdown. We had a game on March 7, our second game of the season. Two days later, the NBA pulls the plug, and every pro sport in the U.S. goes dark. And we went from expecting 5,000 fans a game, like literally the next week, to, how do we keep players safe? Revenue has gone to zero because we can’t sell tickets. We don’t know when they’re coming back. Sponsors are not going to get their sponsorships fulfilled. And it was a time of really worrying questions. And what guided us were actually the values of the organization. And we really thought through, we didn’t know when the pandemic would end and what the outcome might be, but we said, “Right now, we have players and front office staff and coaches who are our responsibility. How do we make sure that we’re doing right by them?” And so we talked to some of our staff. In Oakland, we had staff members where they were the only person in their entire family—parents had been unemployed because of COVID, siblings had been laid off because of COVID. So we had people who they were the only breadwinners still in the family.*

*And we thought that while we couldn’t play games in front of fans, maybe we could use this opportunity. And George Floyd had not yet been killed, and so we didn’t have that pillar yet to rely on, but we started to think through, “All right, let’s start to think about using digital, in particular, all of the ways to reach out to folks online to tell the brand story, to tell stories of our staff.” And then George Floyd gets murdered, and now you have this intersection of people that are at home; they’re angry; they’re sad; they’re disappointed. You have a flashpoint in major cities, including Oakland. And so our staff is very diverse, our player base is very diverse, our coaching staff is very diverse. And so we asked them to tell their stories, and they were powerful and meaningful. And I think we did what we could do, which was the medium available to us, was our brand and our people. The web, through Instagram and YouTube, and Facebook at the time, was the only way we could get the stories out there. And so we concentrated on storytelling, and we concentrated on helping members of the community that we couldn’t see, but we could talk to and touch.*

(Stella)

*I think it’s awesome, Steven. I think you’ve really pointed out that sports have this, like, unifying factor to them, and how even in times of need when people really do need that unification, you were able to bring people together and get those voices heard. That’s a really important thing.*

(Steven)

*Thank you, Stella. Yeah, you think about sports teams, and if you’re not able to play games, most folks would say, “Well then, the sport is irrelevant.” But in fact, the brand, especially when we have Oakland on our crest, the brand really stands for something beyond did you win or lose that day? And we weren’t winning or losing because we weren’t playing any games. And so we had to think through safety, and that was important, and employment, that was important, but how do we become a voice of positivity and how do we become a voice to, in some cases, tell uncomfortable stories, but always from a place of love and hope.*

(Elias)

*As you mentioned earlier in the episode, Steven, we mentioned you previously served as the chief product officer at GoDaddy, and earlier you had served as their senior vice president of business applications. How did the skills that you acquired from these positions transfer into your current role at Oakland Roots?*

(Steven)

*The business world was an amazing place to be for basically my entire career before I became part of the Oakland Roots organization. And what you learn in the business world is that as a leader, you are responsible for ensuring that people understand the connection between their day-to-day work and the purpose of the organization. So that translated beautifully. You also realize as a leader that you’re responsible for seeing the world as it is, but you also need to give people hope. And so I had a boss that I worked for once, Brad Smith, who’s now, I think, the president of Marshall University. And Brad would say, “Look, Steven, we’re all dealers of hope. You can understand how dire the situation is, but you have to find what’s that pathway through that you can credibly tell the folks around you that this is going to be okay and give people those things to hold on to when they’re fighting through adversity.” And so I think the time I had at GoDaddy and even before that at Intuit, we were building companies that were touching millions and millions of small businesses around the world, and every day those small businesses were having to do work that was really hard and really meaningful, and yet we were there to be their support and their guide.*

*And I think understanding that as a leader we were actually in service to those small businesses really helped my mindset when I joined the Roots because I was in service to the organization; I was in service as a steward to the town. And so that mentality, that mindset, served me really well. There was stuff I didn’t know very much about that I had to learn around the business of sport, but the concept of how to lead and lead from a position of “I am here to serve others” was something that I took away from the business world, in addition to just a bunch of what I’d call hard skills. So, how do you negotiate? How do you write job descriptions? How do you hire people? How do you connect the dots between different functions? There are some things that you learn really well in the business world that apply to any business that’s complicated.*

(Elias)

*Thank you for sharing that, Steven.*

(Stella)

*So one of the things that we really enjoyed learning about you, while kind of doing some looking into your LinkedIn, was we couldn’t help but notice that you describe yourself as a former foil fencer. And for me, at least, that’s a lot of alliteration, and we had to look up exactly what that meant. But what exactly are your favorite memories as co-captain of the fencing team at Carolina?*

(Steven)

*Yeah, that was an amazing four years here at Carolina. I had come in assuming I was going to play soccer. I was a goalkeeper growing up and thought of myself as a goalkeeper. And when the opportunity to join the fencing team came around, and I met Coach Ron Miller, who was here for over 50 years, his vision of coach—when I would look up in the dictionary, what does “coach” say? Like, Coach Miller’s name would be there. And that’s because my memories of him, when we would say, “Coach, we need help on technique, we need help on this or that,” he was always willing to spend the time and would never treat a question as dumb or silly. Like, he assumed that, hey, if you don’t know it, he will help you learn it. And so the level of patience he exhibited, the level of willingness to share his knowledge, and he’d been doing it by the time I was on the team for decades already. Every year when I was on the team, he would come back with something new, like he was constantly reinventing. How do we train? How do we make it interesting? How do we keep people connected? And that was so impressive.*

*And a couple of fun memories from those few years, as a senior, we were on a team that had some scholarship athletes, but most of us were not scholarship athletes at the time. The fencing team was not an ACC sport, but it was an NCAA sport. So we had a goal to make the NCAA Championships. The only way to get there was to be one of the top two teams in your region. We had the Ivies in our region, Penn State, Notre Dame, teams that recruited fencers literally from all over the world. So we had a really good regular season, but there was a regional championship, and the top two teams would get to go, and then there was a third team that would be selected as an alternate. We had to beat Penn State, we had to beat Notre Dame, we had to beat Columbia. And so, as we started to go through the day, we’d had a good regular season, but we were just on fire. And I remember this one bout against probably what became the number one fencer at Penn State. He was a left-handed fencer. I was a right-handed fencer. And it was a tight bout, went down to the last point. I won the bout, my teammates won their bouts, and we wound up in second place, and made the NCAA Championships as a senior. And it was a team effort. Like a lot of these sports, you are fencing one person on the other end of the strip at a time. But every day in practice, we’re fighting and cheering for each other. And I think we were the stronger team, even though all these other teams had better individual fencers, which is kind of crazy to think about, but that was the spirit of team and teamwork that Coach Miller preached every day.*

(Stella)

*That’s awesome. I think it’s really cool that the people that you talk about in your life, your coach, your old boss in business, and at GoDaddy, you talk about being dealers of hope. And I think both of those people gave you your hope to keep succeeding. I think that’s really awesome.*

(Steven)

*Thank you.*

(Stella)

*Also, speaking of Carolina, we did some more digging, and we were surprised to see that you received your bachelor’s degree in physics. We would not have thought that based on your accomplishments so far. And we also see that you have some other amazing business pursuits, such as serving as the chair of the Bay Area Glass Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to teaching glass artists in the Bay Area. So when thinking about all of these really interesting pursuits that kind of take lots of different fields and are in lots of different fields, what is one piece of advice that you have for scholars or any alumni who might be listening to this podcast who may feel torn between many passions and choosing kind of what to pursue in the future?*

(Steven)

*Wow, that’s a hard question. I can construct a story backward looking at how all the things I’ve done have led to where I am today. But if you’d asked me as a senior at Carolina what was in store for me, there is no possible way I would have played out the story as it’s played out. There’s just no way. I think if you had asked roughly what I’d be doing, I said, “I want to help a technology company grow.” That was a pretty consistent theme, but the steps along the way were serendipity, so I was open to new ideas as they popped up. A lot of those came through people that I talked to, and so a piece of advice is to never turn down an opportunity for a conversation. You might learn something new that could set up a pathway that previously was just unknown to you. And I think that the opportunities are really limitless if you’re willing to make choices. And so I think one of the things that I feel pretty strongly about is that you don’t have an opportunity to predict the future, but you have an opportunity to make conscious decisions as to how you want to spend your time. And that I’d much rather be in a position of making conscious choices for what I’m going to do with my time than have it done to me. And if I’m making choices on my own, it’s going to be hard, it’s going to be challenging. Things are going to be painful from time to time, or maybe a lot of the time, and yet, if I’ve made the decision to be in that position, then I need to get myself out of it or make things better. And so I think the conscious choice of doing what you want to do is key. And again, the work won’t always be glamorous. It won’t always be fun. But if you’re mentally in that position, if I chose to be here, I think it’s a positive thing.*

*And then maybe the last piece related to all of that is to the extent you can integrate your interests. So as we talked earlier, the Roots and now the women’s team coming, the Soul combine a number of different things I’ve done over time, both in terms of skills I’ve learned, organizations I’ve worked with, causes that I’ve been excited about. And if you can integrate those different interests and passions and people, you don’t have to choose. You have the ability to create not an “or,” but an “and.” I think that type of life is so much less stressful than having to lop things off, and you still have to make choices. But the more things I can do with people I like that bring causes and businesses and ideas together, the happier I feel.*

(Elias)

*I think that’s such a beautiful response, seeing how you can have different silos of different interests and still be able to integrate them into something that you love. And I think that’s something that you’ve been able to execute so wonderfully throughout your career. I wanted to ask if you had any particular experiences with Morehead-Cain, perhaps a summer enrichment program or a conversation that you had with an older scholar or alumni that really changed your interests and kind of had you thinking, “What if I went in this direction instead?”*

(Steven)

*Yeah, the summer program back in the late ’80s, when I was here, opened my eyes to lots of different things. And I was thinking about this the other day. I was talking with another friend, and I think what was most interesting to me wasn’t the specific content of my summers but the geography of my summers. It may sound a little bit weird, but the places I went actually wound up being more meaningful than the things that I did. So I spent my first summer in Outward Bound in the Sangre de Cristo region between Utah and Colorado. It’s a beautiful spot, and so the mountains continue to be something impactful for me, although I have to say, I am not an outdoors person in any way, shape, or form. Some scary stories from that experience. The next summer was in Palo Alto. So I was out in the public sector in the police department in Palo Alto. I went to graduate school at Stanford. We live in the town next to Palo Alto now. And so there’s this distinctive smell of jasmine that I remember from that summer, that every time I’m going through an area of town that has those flowers, which is often in the summer, I’m brought back instantly to that summer of 1988. The next summer, I was in Philadelphia, first time in a big town, again worked in industry, but that was less important than being in Philly and making my way in a big town for the first time. And then my travel study was in Europe just after the Wall had fallen. So I traveled in Eastern Europe and in Western Europe to kind of compare what was happening in 1990. And the World Cup was happening that summer as well in Italy. And so the places and the things that were happening were more impactful than exactly what I did each summer. And so I think that’s what I took away from those summers. Interestingly, there wasn’t any one crystallizing moment, but it was those things that really brought home what I now look back on and say, “Wow, those places were significant.” And that’s a pretty neat thing to look back on. I would not have had that opportunity if it hadn’t been for the Morehead-Cain.*

(Elias)

*And just hearing you speak and watching your face kind of shine when you’re talking about these summer experiences, it really goes to show just how unique and diverse the experiences that scholars have today.*

(Steven)

*Thank you. Yeah. One interesting quick story which has nothing to do with my summers, but I went to the School of Science and Math for my junior and senior year of high school in North Carolina. Fast forward more than 15 years later, we’re living in California. A group of students from Science and Math comes out for a trip to the Bay Area, Silicon Valley. A young man is on that trip. He’s from the mountains of North Carolina. This is his first time out of the state, and we have a conversation, and it turns out he’s applied for the Morehead-Cain Scholarship. He gets it. He then comes and interns with me when I’m at GoDaddy as a product manager that summer, and did some engineering as well. He then graduates, comes out, and works in Silicon Valley now as an engineer. And now he and I are friends, and so we’re a generation apart. But Morgan Howell (’17), who’s an amazing alum Morehead-Cain scholar, like, I think about his trajectory of his life and the experiences that he had at Morehead-Cain, and just his experience. Now he’s giving back to the hometown where he grew up, even though he lives in California, helping entrepreneurs in his hometown back here in North Carolina.*

*My story is obviously not unique. When I think about Morgan and other folks I’ve interacted with, just the desire to give back and the realization of the position that we have been given, and how do we use that as a place to make impact and make the world a better location for everyone.*

(Stella)

*I think that is amazing, and I think that even as a freshman, Elias and I can see that there is this love in the alumni network of giving back to the scholarship, which I think is really awesome. And I think we both aspire to do the same. Kind of going, flipping gears back to Oakland Roots, just like that same passion that the scholarship Morehead-Cain gives of giving back, we really see that as you continue building upon in the future on Oakland Roots. What do you feel like you hope that the impact of the soccer club is in the future, and what do you really hope that your impact is in the city of Oakland?*

(Steven)

*Yeah, we’re wanting to be a unifying force across the different groups, the different geographies, the different neighborhoods. We want game days to be a celebration in the city. We want thousands of people to get together, march to the match, have a great time, think of it as an opportunity to be with your neighbors, young and old, black and white, brown. And it’s an amazing opportunity for us to be a focal point, and literally, right at the center of town where we play today is the dividing line between a bunch of these neighborhoods. And so our view is that as the world unfolds in Oakland, we get the women’s team up and running. We can tell stories about both racial equity and gender equity that we keep growing and that will be as big as the town wants us to be. And I hope that means we go from 5,000 fans a game to 10,000 fans a game and beyond, that folks get excited about the impact we’re making and volunteer more in their own neighborhood. Like, hey, they don’t need to be a part of what we’re doing, like, find something in your neighborhood that you’re excited about, make it better.*

*And so if we can inspire people to serve others just a bit more, and there are a lot of people doing amazing things already on the ground. And the last piece, I hope, is that people tell amazing stories about Oakland. Like they think of what the city is and all of its positivity around creativity and innovation and social activism. And that story is what’s in the headlines every day. And that’s really what we’re trying to drive is you’ll make that hope a reality.*

(Stella)

*Yeah, I think you keep talking about Oakland Soul, which is your new women’s purpose driven women’s soccer league. And I’m wondering what kind of efforts have been made to incorporate women into sports, and what do you think the importance of having that women’s-only soccer team is in Oakland?*

(Steven)

*Yeah, it’s, you know, so important, I think, for people to see people like themselves doing the activity that they aspire to. It’s really hard to be something you can’t see. And so when we were getting the women’s team up and running, we thought very deliberately about where are we going to find those women on the staff side. And we don’t have to hire women, but we think it’s the right thing to do. There are so many talented women that aren’t currently in positions of leadership. We knew we were eventually going to put the women’s team together, and we hadn’t yet formulated the plan completely. But part of our drive to make that happen is we hired a woman out of business school out on the West Coast to put the plan together. She had played soccer, she was excited about the mission. And as we started digging into women’s soccer in the U.S., there’s this huge number of women now that are incredibly talented athletes playing in the college level. And in the U.S., there’s currently ten pro women soccer teams. That’s it. So if you’re not one of essentially those eleven starters times ten, you’re not playing soccer professionally on a regular basis.*

*So a lot of my friends whose daughters went overseas to play soccer, let’s keep them in the States, let’s have them stay here, let’s have them develop here, and build a pathway for many more players to play, pursue their passion to be a coach, to be a front office leader. And in fact, our leader, the president of the club who started more than a year ago now, Lindsay Barenz, is one of the only female leaders of a pro sports team, period, in the U.S. Our technical director is a man, Jordan Ferrell, he happens to be black. And so I think what we have purposefully done and are incorporating into our Soul efforts as well is, you know, put people who are totally qualified but have been passed over for reasons that I think have a lot to do with bias in hiring, and make sure that our hiring processes are unbiased so that we get the best candidate, regardless of where they came from or who knew them or their color or their gender. And that allows you to put a team together that’s there for a singular purpose, which is make Oakland healthier, happier, more equitable. And we can do that on the field and off the field. And that’s something that gets me really excited every day.*

(Stella)

*That’s really awesome. I think, as a woman, that makes me super happy. And even just like at UNC, like watching how many people go to the U.S. women’s soccer games compared to the men’s and how amazing our women are that play on the field, I think that’s really awesome that that’s in Soul sports games in the future.*

(Steven)

*Thank you. Yeah, it’s super exciting. And UNC has an incredible history of women’s soccer excellence. And Anson, I think, is one of those role models for coaches who has just kept doing it, similar to Coach Miller on the fencing team, for decades and decades and always finding ways to be on the top.*

(Elias)

*Steven, thank you so much for joining the podcast today. We hope to see you at upcoming Morehead-Cain events, perhaps even sports games. I know you’re going to be at the NC State game later this afternoon, so I look forward to seeing you there.*

(Steven)

*Thank you. Appreciate it.*

(Stella)

*Yeah, we really thank you for sitting down with us. You talked about all of your dealers of hope, and we want you to know that you are really a dealer of hope for us, too, and Oakland Roots and just all of your business aspirations that you’ve been doing. So really thank you. Is there anything else you want to add before we end the podcast?*

(Steven)

*There’s one thing that I give my dad a lot of credit for, and he, from an entrepreneur, is a professor, but actually he’s studied entrepreneurship basically much of his career. And when I was getting my first business off the ground, he was quite worried, actually, about would it succeed or not, but he didn’t tell me that directly. He talked to my wife, and later on I was talking to him, and he knows the statistics that many small businesses don’t make it. And I talked to him a lot about it, and what he said was, “Look, a lot of folks wait too long to get something going, and yes, your business fails, but in fact, what his data has shown is that starting something and not being successful gives you the knowledge to try it again and maybe be successful the next time.” And so, I think the one sentence encapsulation of that growth mindset concept is “start before you’re ready.” If you start before you’re ready, the worst thing that happens is that you learn something you didn’t know before, and you get back up and try it again.*

(Stella)

*Awesome. Thank you so much.*

(Elias)

*Thank you so much.*

## Episode Transcription

*Good morning, everybody.*

*Among its many impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic has centered the problem of diminishing public trust in medical experts, and concerns over the role of power and politics in science, medicine, and public health. For many, these issues are deeply alarming. In April, for example, I ran across a headline lamenting the ruinous effects of the politicization of public health agencies, such as the CDC. But in these seven minutes, I want to open with you a different conversation about the relationship between medicine and politics. I want to share why embracing what I see as the inherent political nature of medicine has inspired my career.*

*I teach sociology of health and medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago. My classes focus on the political dimensions of public health interventions, past and present, political dimensions of our health care system, and of medical knowledge. I ask my students, many of whom are on a pre-med track, to consider how medicine has been leveraged by some to maintain social power and privilege, and how it might be leveraged to challenge social inequality. Similarly, I encourage my students to think about why some seeming moonshots, like mapping the human genome, become national scientific projects, while other challenges, like ensuring clean air and clean water do not.*

*In short, my goal is to motivate students to recognize medicine in public health as sites of struggle for social justice and to be open to engaging with that struggle. I know this is a complex issue. Lack of public trust in the CDC and political struggles over the agency’s regulatory decisions have cost human lives over the course of the pandemic. But the answer is not to try to isolate medicine and public health from politics, social influence, or controversy, nor does history suggest that such isolation is possible.*

*One of the examples I share with my students is the Black Panther Party’s health activism in the late 1960s and 70s, documented in the book Body and Soul by Alondra Nelson. While the Black Panthers are more often remembered for encounters with law enforcement, Nelson’s book examines how the party mobilized around the idea of health as a human right, demanding improved health care access, the separation of medicine and market imperatives, and a shift in the balance of power between clinicians and their patients across the nation. Collaborating with leftleaning medical activists, the party built a network of people’s free clinics. They established a clinical culture in which mostly white providers studied authors like Franz Finan (??) to better grasp the relationship between oppression and health, and a clinical culture in which black patients were empowered not only to demand respect from and to question their providers, but also to take medicine into their own hands, offering blood pressure screening, performing PAP smears across their communities.*

*As the case of the Panther suggests, in the United States and beyond, there’s a history of social movements that have productively targeted medical knowledge and practice. We just often aren’t taught that history.*

*A second example I share with students illustrates a different kind of politics. In this case, how national political agendas can transform scientific practice. In her book, Exposed Science, Sarah Shostak investigates why the field of toxicology shifted away from its original focus on identifying toxins in the ambient environment, turning increasingly inward, concentrating deep inside the human body on DNA. With this, the question of how particular genetic predispositions influence individuals susceptibility to toxins moved from the periphery to the center of the field. Further, rather than disease prevention, this new emphasis on genetic predisposition meant toxicology shifted toward clinical research, or research that could contribute to treating and curing disease once an individual was already sick. So why this change in toxicology? Scientists explained to Shostak that as the U.S. government boldly committed itself to mapping the human genome, they found the distribution of power and money within the National Institutes of Health increasingly dependent on engagement with the promise of genetic and genomic science. Environmental scientists shifted to focus on DNA, in no small part out of self preservation from a funding perspective, not because this necessarily made for good science.*

*My own research focuses on the politics of diabetes prevention in Mexico, specifically, the different sets of social actors who have had influence over the kinds of prevention efforts that have been adopted. Working primarily in Mexico City, I follow closely groups of activists who have mobilized in street protests and lobbied Congress to institute and maintain attacks on sugar sweetened beverages. They name names, assigning blame for the country’s chronic disease crisis to companies like Coca-Cola and Nestle. I compare their demands to focus prevention efforts on food policy reform with those of elite entrepreneurs increasingly engaging in health philanthropy in Mexico. These philanthropists have promoted tech-based solutions to the diabetes epidemic, like apps that individuals can use to access and monitor their diabetes risk from their smartphones. And it’s these elites who enjoy easy access to policymakers, pushing an agenda of tech-empowered individual responsibility, rather than taking the processed food industry to task. Both groups are pursuing prevention. Both are working for better health outcomes in Mexico. But they are doing so based on an entirely different set of political commitments and vision for what the Mexican state’s role is in supporting a right to health. As these cases show, rather than being ruinous for medicine or an anomaly during COVID-19, politics and medicine are inextricably intertwined.*

*My teaching and research centers this fact, not to diminish the authority of medicine, but instead to imagine ways that it might be continually and increasingly enlisted in struggles for equity.*

*Thank you.*

[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Edward Ndopu, UN SDG Advocate for Accessibility and Inclusion

Humanitarian Edward Ndopu joined Catalyze co-hosts Sarah O’Carroll and Elias Guedira ’26 during his visit to the Morehead-Cain Foundation this spring. Ndopu represents accessibility and inclusion as one of the 17 official UN Advocates for the Sustainable Development Goals.

Ndopu shares about his experiences becoming the first disabled Black man to receive a master’s degree from Oxford University, his career in activism for intersectional disability justice, and advice for leaders in higher education to envision “radical inclusion” on college campuses.

Ndopu also previews his upcoming memoir, *Drinking Dom Perignon Through a Straw*, and talks about what it would be like to be the first disabled person to travel to space.

Edward delivered a Food for Thought talk on January 27 to an audience of Morehead-Cain Scholars and students at UNC–Chapel Hill. The breakfast and conversation series is held on Fridays at the Foundation this semester. [Learn more and RSVP for upcoming events](https://www.moreheadcain-network.org/events) on the Morehead-Cain Network.

## Episode transcription

(Elias)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Elias Guedira, from the class of 2026.*

(Sarah)

*And I’m Sarah O’Carroll, the content manager for Morehead-Cain.*

(Elias)

*Joining us today is Eddie Ndopu, one of the 17 official UN Advocates for the Sustainable Development Goals. With a focus on accessibility and inclusion, Mr. Ndopu works at the intersection of sustainability, disability, race, and social justice.*

(Sarah)

*Eddie serves as a special advisor to RTW Investments, an investment firm with the mission of biotech and medical innovation. In addition, Eddie has advised prominent organizations, including the World Economic Forum, UN Women, and Amnesty International.*

(Elias)

*We had the privilege of listening to Eddie at the Food for Thought breakfast this morning, hosted at the Morehead-Cain Foundation. Thank you for joining the pod today, Mr. Ndopu.*

(Edward)

*Of course. Thank you for having me. I’m absolutely delighted.*

(Elias)

*How are you enjoying your time in Chapel Hill so far?*

(Edward)

*I love it. It’s a glorious day. It’s sunny, and the conversations that I’ve had so far have been incredibly robust. Great questions. It’s an incredible community, and I’m so thrilled to be here.*

(Sarah)

*And, Eddie, you said this was your first time in North Carolina. Is that right?*

(Edward)

*It is. Well, I actually just moved to the US about a year and a half ago. I live in New York City, and I think it was two pronged. The first was really for medical reasons. I was diagnosed at the age of two with a neuromuscular condition called spinal muscular atrophy, and I was given a prognosis of five \[years\]. But I’ve obviously outlived myself now about 26 years and counting. But I was earmarked for groundbreaking treatment called Evrysdi. So I was brought up from South Africa to embark on this new treatment, and it’s been incredibly transformative for my life. But also my work is quite global, and given my affiliation with the United Nations, based here in New York, it just seemed like the right time to move. So, yeah, I’m so excited to be living here permanently now.*

(Sarah)

*Well, we’re glad to have you on the East Coast. And you also know Chris Bradford from his time at African Leadership Academy in high school. Can you share a little bit about that?*

(Edward)

*I do. So I was actually a member of the inaugural class of 2008, and Chris Bradford actually interviewed me way back when I was 16 years old at the time. Seems like a lifetime ago. And Chris and I really have such an incredible relationship. I really have huge admiration for him and his commitment to cultivating the next generation of leaders, not just on the continent of Africa, but globally. So this feels like a full circle moment. It feels like a reunion. So very special.*

(Sarah)

*Well, I know it’s a special moment for him as well.*

(Elias)

*Eddie, you’ve shared quite a bit about your experience in the past growing up as someone who is physically disabled. While you were growing up, was there anybody in your youth, whether that was a mentor, friend, or someone in global media, that you felt represented or even empowered by?*

(Edward)

*The honest answer to that is no. I think that part of the challenge for so many young people with disabilities, especially those of us from the Global South, is that we don’t have points of reference as far as possibility is concerned. I have always been deeply cognizant of the fact that somewhere between 90 and 98% of children with disabilities living in the Global South, particularly on the African continent, have never been to school. And that could have so easily been my life. But thanks to the tenacity of my mother, a single parent, she knocked on every door to ensure that I was able to attain an education within the mainstream education system. And I think that that was the turning point. I remember at the age of about six, looking in my mom’s eyes, and telling her, “I’d like to be like my younger brother, Wonga, and I’d like to go to school.” Of course, my younger brother was only in preschool, but that was semantics, really, for my developing brain. But I think that was the defining moment in my life that sort of set me on this path to be able to emerge as a disabled African with the world opening up for me.*

*So growing up, I sort of had to become my own point of reference, which was challenging. And I think today I’m really heartened because I get to be a point of reference now for other young people and kids with disabilities growing up.*

(Elias)

*That’s so wonderful. And you talked about your decision, choosing to embark on an educational journey being a turning point, and now you get to be a turning point for so many other people as well. My question for you is, you went on to attend Oxford University. You became the first African person with muscular dystrophy to graduate from that university with a degree in public policy. I was wondering if you connected with anybody there or you found purpose in other people with disabilities or other people who were marginalized in these spaces and how that really shaped your activism?*

(Edward)

*Yeah, it’s a great question. Oxford, for me was truly the fulfillment of a lifelong dream to really be on the global stage. It sort of represents the pinnacle of achievement, and in some ways, it was a little bit of uncharted territory. I got to Oxford, and I didn’t really know what to expect, and I think the institution also didn’t know what to expect. And so, in some ways, we were kind of building the aircraft as it was flying, for lack of a better term. And it was challenging. It was really incredibly hard. And I think in some ways, it was surprising to discover that even at the dizzying height of success as a disabled person, I was still confronted with some of the structural barriers that people with disabilities face day in and day out. That Oxford, while an incredible institution with a 900 year plus history, also did not quite know what to do with all of the needs that I had and all of the challenges. And so, very quickly, I found myself in a very precarious situation. The nature of my disability is such that I need 24/7 care, and the full scholarship that I received did not make room for this need.*

*And so over and above just wanting to be a student like everybody else, I suddenly had to sort of advocate for myself full time. And I think that kind of illuminated for me the fact that we still have a long way to go. And I thought that achievement and success, it would inoculate me against some of these inequities that people with disabilities face. But in some ways, I think it’s even more difficult at the very top because there’s so few of us. And so it was a bit of a rude awakening. But I’ve emerged from that experience, I think, more committed than ever to ensuring that we focus on the self-actualization of people with disabilities over and above the attainment of education.*

(Sarah)

*In your talk this morning, you talked about not just thinking of radical inclusion, but radical humanity, and really humanizing people, rather than just thinking of compliance. Can you share a little more about that concept and whether you saw some changes at Oxford since you’ve graduated in that respect?*

(Edward)

*Yeah, sure. So what I’ll say is that compliance is how we currently do public policy. It’s about ensuring that we fall in line with certain protocols, that we fall in line with sort of what is expected. And of course, we need compliance to be able to enforce change, but we don’t get to systemic change through compliance. Compliance only takes us so far. And I say time and time again, I sort of sound like a broken record at this point, but I think it’s important to repeat this, that what makes the space accessible isn’t the ramp, right? It provides entry into a building, but what makes the space accessible is really the ability to feel validated and to have some agency and dignity once you’re in that space, for everybody, regardless of disability. So in some ways, radical humanity is about pushing the boundaries of possibility, recognizing that when we navigate spaces, we do so as human beings, not as items to be checked off on the checklist. And so that’s really the invitation that radical humanity is sort of saying that real inclusion means attending to the fullness of one’s human experience and not just whether they’re able to be pigeonholed into a kind of predetermined institutional set up.*

*I’d like to think that through my story, Oxford has hopefully been inspired to change. So that’s my hope. And of course, the memoir, my forthcoming memoir, Sipping Dom Perignon Through a Straw, really chronicles my time there, and hopefully will offer up a blueprint of what to do, but also what not to do.*

(Sarah)

*And is there anything you can share about the timeline for the release or anything else you can give as a teaser?*

(Edward)

*Yes, I am so excited. So the book is slated for publication in June, this summer. It’s going to be published worldwide by Hachette, and I’m so thrilled. It really is my love letter, I think, to the power of the human spirit. Of course, the dedication is to disabled people everywhere, but it really is a manual for nondisabled people, as well, to really glean some insight and perspective into the lived experience. So I’m so thrilled. I call it my anti-grit memoir because in some ways I think that grit can be a little bit harmful, right? I’m sort of a recovering sort of believer in that sense, that grit is all one needs. But in the absence of institutional support, grit only takes you so far. And so this is my call to action, to go beyond the individual, and start thinking about what needs to be put in place at a structural level to ensure that people have the tools to be able to succeed.*

(Sarah)

*Well, there’s no accountability for systems, for organizations, if you’re just looking at the individual and personal experience and things like that.*

(Edward)

*Absolutely, you’ve hit the nail on the head. And I think for disabled achievers, in particular, I think that we are saddled with that baggage a little bit. Like we want to prove that our disability is not getting in the way of our ability to perform. But I think we often do that at the expense of our own mental health, of our own emotional wellness. Where the institution fails, we overcompensate by pushing our bodies too far, by doing more than what we ought to do. And I think that’s sort of, it’s a bit of a failure, I think, of society and structural arrangements. And so it’s my hope that this book will offer a paradigm shift in that regard.*

(Sarah)

*We look forward to its release.*

(Elias)

*One thing that I noticed was really interesting while you were speaking earlier is that you kind of used a ramp as a symbol for a gateway to accessibility, but not necessarily something that keeps disabled people in a place and allows them to achieve their full potential. I wanted to ask, what kind of work can we do to ensure that accessibility and inclusion is sustainable and long lasting? And what measures are being taken to uplift newcomers into this realm of advocacy and keep them engaged?*

(Edward)

*Yeah, so I think the best way, I think we need to keep revisiting the language. I think we need to go back, and just when we think we’ve defined accessibility, I think that’s the time for us to go back and look again. I think the words that we use—inclusion, equity, diversity, belonging—these are important but in some ways, they’ve become hollowed out a little bit of their true meaning. I think we constantly need to ask ourselves, what do we mean when we say accessibility? What do we mean when we say inclusion? What are we really after? And I think paying attention to those underlying objectives and the underlying values that we want to espouse is how we begin to move the needle in a meaningful way. So, again, not conflating the installation of a ramp and equipment with true accessibility, that what we want are people who are validated and who are able to thrive regardless of disability. That that requires more intervention. It’s not just necessarily making the built environment accessible, but we need to be thinking about other metrics as well. And so I think paying attention and constantly revisiting and reinterrogating these concepts, I think will serve us well.*

(Elias)

*I think that’s such a valuable point for people like me, especially, who don’t have a disability, to really understand and make sure that the jargon that we’re using actually carries meaning with it and that our actions, we act without cognitive dissonance.*

(Edward)

*Absolutely.*

(Sarah)

*And Eddie, having spent your entire career engaging with organizations and government bodies, trying to get them to think past the institutionalization and compliance and words that have become hollowed out, what advice do you have for UNC’s leadership as they grapple with these issues and confront the same things that Oxford has been going through or did when you were at the university? And I know you’re meeting with the chancellor later today, so what’s on your mind as you think about that meeting?*

(Edward)

*I think what’s on my mind really is this question, I think leadership has to ask itself, what kind of environment are we creating? And I think what gets lost in the accessibility conversation is that we’re often stuck in the minutiae of compliance. To kind of repeat this again, we’re kind of bogged down by kind of the policy, what’s right, what’s not right, without necessarily thinking about what is the end goal, what is the objective here? And if the objective is to foster an environment where you attract talent from all corners of the world, from all perspectives, from all backgrounds, if that is your goal, then disabled people, and disabled students specifically in this context, are at the cornerstone of that. And so paying attention to accessibility and inclusion is not a legal question in a compliance framework, it is actually a question of how you make this institution fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. There’s a larger goal there. And so that would be my hope, is that the leadership sort of sees this conversation not as a separate issue, but as part and parcel of the main objectives for how you grow this institution and make it into a beacon of knowledge and research and cutting-edge thinking.*

(Sarah)

*So I’m hearing about the challenges of let’s get past just liability and these basic bare minimum questions. But I’m wondering, how do we inform leadership? What stories do they need to hear? Or what expertise from academia or otherwise could help broaden that vision, such that it’s not just how do we not become in a legal situation, but having a true vision of what a radical, humane, and welcoming environment could look like?*

(Edward)

*That’s a really great question. And I think part of that is to… it involves interrogating our own assumptions, right? So I think we need to start taking disability studies as a serious discipline. I think that this space is endowed with remarkable thinkers, with public policy experts, cultural innovators, storytellers who really bring, who really illuminate the disability experience in all of its complexity and glory. And I think if we just paid attention to the voices that are coming out of this community, brilliant, razor sharp people who are offering incisive analysis about the structure of the world through the lens of disability. If we start taking that seriously, then I think we’ll begin to see that, oh, actually disabled people have so much to offer. We’re not just perennially complaining about the lack of accessibility, but that we’re actually helping to shape the future. We’re actually helping to shape discourse, right? That I am not just Eddie, somebody living with a disability. I am an expert and an intellectual in the space of disability inclusion. And when we start validating the intellectual contributions of disabled people, I think that’s when we begin to see a change, that disability is not just a lived experience, it’s a serious area of critical inquiry. It’s an area of philosophical engagement, cultural engagement. And so opening up the canon and bringing it to the mainstream, I think will go a long way.*

(Elias)

*In our research for this episode, we noticed that Time magazine featured you in a piece talking about your desire to enter the next frontier: space. The author described in his words that you will float free from the wheelchair that typically confines you. What do you expect this to feel like? And does the prospect excite or even scare you?*

(Edward)

*It’s a great question. So I’ve been pursuing this for a while, and I kind of put it on hold so that I could focus on the book. And since I first made this public a couple of years ago that I’ve got this intention of wanting to go to space, it’s actually, it shook up the sector. And we see that various disabled people are sort of entering the space and trying to figure out how we could make outer space accessible to all. So I’m just looking forward to it. I think it would be such an incredible statement of possibility. And I think just to be able to feel my body in a different way will be probably a little bit trippy. I think it might be one of those things where you’re like, “Oh, wow!” But I think the opportunity to feel my body experiencing a different kind of sensation, there’s something about that that’s a bit thrilling.*

(Elias)

*I think that the idea is incredibly interesting because earlier in your talk this morning, you spoke in very similar language when describing what it would feel like to have equity down on Earth. So by launching it to space and being able to be recognized and respected up there, it’s showing that the possibilities are really limitless down here as well.*

(Edward)

*I love that, you’ve just made me appreciate that more. I think you’re absolutely right. I think if we can achieve that feat, then we can make accessible transportation available. If we can send somebody with a profound disability into space, and we can make sure that every disabled person, no matter where they are, that they’re able to get from point A to point B quite seamlessly.*

(Elias)

*Thank you so much, Eddie.*

(Sarah)

*And in that same article you shared, if I have five minutes to talk to the world, what would I say to capture humanity’s attention? Have you thought more about what that would be?*

(Edward)

*I think I’m still thinking about it, but I think it will be more along this line, along the lines of radical humanity. I think that astronauts often talk about the overview effect, that once they’re in space, they look down on Earth and they see the fragility of the planet, the thin layer that covers the Earth, and they become champions for environmental justice, and they begin to realize that this is the only home that we have. And I think the overview effect, from the perspective of disability, I think will offer new insights and thinking into how that fragility doesn’t just extend to the planet as our home, but to ourselves. That we navigate fragility day in and day out. And instead of running away from it or being fearful, what if we leaned into it? What if we leaned into embracing the fragility of our bodies and the vulnerability of our bodies and the precariousness that we navigate? And I think that ableism, a deconstruction of ableism gets us to that place where we’re not fearful of our limits, but we actually see our limits as part and parcel of what it means to be a human being.*

(Sarah)

*The last Food for Thought speaker was Dr. Ryan Hickox from Dartmouth College, and I wish that we could get the two of you in a room because he shared about space and just gave us a sense of what it’s like to research black holes and consider questions of humanity. But of course we’re running out of time. So thank you so much for sharing what you have with us. And Elias, any closing question you’d like to ask?*

(Elias)

*What is one book or piece of media that you engaged with recently, and how did it connect to you?*

(Edward)

*I recently read a memoir by Natasha Trethewey called Memorial Drive, and it was just so harrowing, but also incredibly impactful, sort of talking about gender violence and gender inequity, and it just left such a mark on me. I love memoir because I think it really offers, it’s a different way of being able to analyze structures but through the human perspective.*

(Elias)

*And I’m sure that we have another memoir to look forward to soon.*

(Edward)

*Yes, we do.*

(Sarah)

## Episode Transcription

*How are we doing? The first time I visited the metaverse, I was twelve. My dad upgraded our dialup modem, and I was connecting from Nebraska to America Online. I begged for months to join the revolution sweeping the nation, and at last, I got mail. The early internet was slow, but it was alive. Instant Messenger was the new agent of human connection, one that got killed when my mom picked up the phone. I learned to type quickly to get my thoughts out because I could ride them beyond the edges of Omaha, exploring infinite knowledge. That protometiverse, the first immersive persistent digital market of ideas, captured all of my attention and grew into the gigantic, multisensory social ecosystem we now live in. Now, rather than get kicked off when I picked off a phone, I fall straight down into it. Our internet, the live streaming global engine of dance moves, has revolutionized culture, while addicting us to the most sophisticated dopamine triggers ever engineered. We read and write, expressing opinion with every click, seeing more of what we like and less of what we don’t. Billions use it. We can’t live without it. It’s everywhere, always on until it’s not.*

*In the past year, governments in 34 countries have shut down the internet 182 times to silence dissent. The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have. So where do we go from here? The year I graduated from Carolina, a paper was published that introduced bitcoin. Of its many innovations, it solved for what’s known as the double-spend problem. In cashless economies, a validator is needed to confirm that a digital token is not being spent over and over. Typically, a bank does this, verifying that money is there, and then transferring. But banks can close down. The paper described a trustless, cryptographic secured network of computers that work together to verify transactions. This is the blockchain, a decentralized ledger designed to be unassailable and immutable. Supporters in this network are incentivized and rewarded with tokens that store value. And even though we already had a good system for file sharing in BitTorrent, torrents weren’t great at storing value because, like most computer files, they can be copied. Bitcoin’s other major shakeup was introducing digital scarcity. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. This is governed by math that rewards these tokens until they run out. Their value defined by a free market rather than a central bank.*

*So, on my birthday twelve years ago, a guy traded 10,000 bitcoin for two large pizzas, pricing a bitcoin at half a penny. Today, after decades of consensus, that dinner would cost $200 million. Bitcoin was made to store value. What it wasn’t built for is proving how cool you are. For that, you still needed Lamborghinis. So, a few years later, this cool guy and his friends invented a new blockchain called Ethereum. Ethereum can execute lines of code based on certain criteria. They turned the blockchain into a computer and started building apps called smart contracts. From digital gold, we now had an internet computer, and that meant banks without bankers, exchanges without Wall Street, businesses with millions of equal partners. And along the way, we discovered that blockchains could authenticate anything: art, concert tickets, collectibles, even identity, through NFTs. A non-fungible token is unique. It’s made to convey ownership of something legit. The token points to a unique item and says, “That’s real, and this guy owns it.”*

*In ancient England, the Saxons sought to kidnap the sororal nephews of rival kings rather than their sons. And the rationale was that the king’s nephew was more likely to be a member of the ruling family because the King’s sister was blood, and the Queen might have a sidepiece. Art historians call this provenance. We assume the Mona Lisa is authentic because the Louvre says so. The first time I heard about art NFTs, I thought, “Why can’t I just right-click save this thing?” Because without that token, I couldn’t prove how it was mine or why or since when.*

*Human interaction is all about emotion. I can tell you that there’s tech that makes web through revolutionary, but there is a magic that can’t be explained when you have a relationship of the mind with a member of your tribe who selected and embodied a character with the same finite collection as you. Bound by that scarcity and story, you explore your shared fears and wonder without ever knowing their name. But in seeing their transparent actions, the honesty of their commerce on an open ledger, know that the artifice and posturing of life can fall away in this space to reveal the secrets of who they really are. It’s cars and coffee. It’s ComicCon. It’s Alumni Forums on the grandest scale.*

*Web3 is the next evolution of human interaction. When you buy a house, you’re watched over by a signature wizard called a notary, who asserts the validity of your agreement with a rubber stamp. Last week, somebody sold a house through an NFT, replacing the wizard and bank and the stamp with one click. We’re witnessing a cultural and technological renaissance in every sector of life. The unbanked have upward mobility through DeFi. Scientists are building capital in shared wallets to invest in issues pharma won’t touch, like longevity and psychedelics. Children’s hospitals are receiving charitable donations in perpetuity for the sales of donated digital art. All of this is happening today, without permission, because blockchains tell the truth. When we reduce the friction of mistrust in our lives, we can be more present. If we stop debating what happened, we can solve problems together. We are already members of the best club in the world, but we meet so rarely. So to help you join me as we build the new internet, you’re all getting a seed, a free token of my love for this room that I promise we can grow into something of purpose if we do it as one.*

*So get out your phones, open your cameras and scan the code, and then put them away in honor of the next speaker. I’m here all weekend to help you set up your wallets and mint the memory of how it feels to be together.*

*Thank you.*

## Episode transcription

(Sarah)

*Josh, thank you so much for speaking with me and Cate here with the Scholar Media team. We’re so looking forward to your Food for Thought talk this morning, so thank you for coming to campus. And Cate Miller is a writer on the team from the class of ’25, and so she’s going to be leading questions. But first, when was the last time you were on campus?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*I think, sadly, it was the UNC game that they just lost to Miami. Very painful.*

(Sarah)

*Yes. Hopefully, things will turn up for us. But Cate, I’ll let you go from here.*

(Cate)

*For our first question, how have your experiences as an attorney and previous work in public service informed your approach to your current position as Attorney General?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*Well, the way I look at my job is I’m a public lawyer, meaning I represent the state. I represent the people of North Carolina. And so you have to do all of your work grounded in the law, the base of which is our constitution, both the US and state constitution. But you also have to add in the impact on people’s lives. And that’s what I try to do. I try to find issues and prioritize issues that are going to make a difference in the lives of North Carolinians.*

(Cate)

*What advice do you have for college students and others in higher education who are pursuing a career in law or public service?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*I think experiment. Just do it, start. A lot of people think, they try to imagine where they’re going to be at the end of their journey, and you never know where that’s going to be. So my view is just do something. And when you do that one thing, you’ll know, did I enjoy it or not? Was I good at it or not? What did I like about it? What didn’t I like about it? So then you can do the next thing, and then you’ll ask yourself the same questions, and then finally, you will find a place where your passions and your talents marry your mission, and then you feel a lot of job satisfaction.*

(Sarah)

*And I’m going to jump in here. Was that the case for you, or did you find yourself in this path another way?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*Pretty much it was the case for me. I knew that I wanted to do something public-service oriented. It was how I was raised. It’s what my faith has taught me. And I started out out of college as a teacher. I was a teacher in Zimbabwe and did that for a couple of years. And I thought, well, maybe I’ll go into international development, maybe I’ll go into education. So, of course, I went into law. And I went, and I got a joint law and public policy degree. And initially, I thought, well, hey, maybe I will do community economic development. And I did that, raising capital to invest in low-wealth communities in eastern North Carolina, renovating dilapidated neighborhoods in Durham, an abandoned building in Wilson, all of which was immensely satisfying. And then I got the political bug and became the consumer protection chief for Roy Cooper, who was then attorney general, current governor, and Morehead, as I understand. He was attorney general, and I headed the consumer protection division and loved that. And basically, what you do is you go to work, and you represent people who are being taken advantage of unfairly by businesses who are breaking the rules. The businesses are harming the consumers, but they’re also harming competitors who are actually following the rules and doing things the right way. And I had no intention of ever leaving that job, but part of that job was working at the General Assembly to get laws passed like a Do Not Call law and an anti-predatory lending law and an identity theft protection law. And in the course of doing that work at the General Assembly, and I saw the breadth of issues that the legislature tackled, I said to myself, “That would be fun.” And a seat came open in Raleigh in 2008, and so I ran for state senate and won that, and enjoyed serving the legislature immensely for eight years, four terms. But then when Cooper announced he was going to run for governor and vacate the attorney general’s office, I said to myself, “Well, here’s an opportunity for me to marry my policy making that I’ve done at the legislature with my legal work that I’d done at the attorney general’s office before. So sort of every step has felt natural and normal. But if you had told me in college that I was going to be attorney general, I would not have predicted it.*

(Sarah)

*And probably be a bit more stressed.*

(Cate)

*Can you share any updates on your plans to run for governor of North Carolina in the upcoming election?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*And I think that is a natural segue from the previous question, which is, did I imagine myself running for governor? No. But having served as attorney general and seen the absolute critical nature of who is the governor, really, over the last ten years, from the six years when Governor Cooper has served and handled immense challenges, I mean, my goodness, COVID and HB2, and all this stuff where North Carolina was really behind the eight ball, he provided steady, solid leadership that I think has served the people of North Carolina extremely well. And then you contrast it with the previous four years, where the governor went in lockstep with a legislature that I believe is to the right of the people of North Carolina, pushing extreme legislation, whether it’s anti-gay or anti-voter and anti-choice. So we need a governor who can serve as a counterbalance to our very conservative General Assembly. And when I look around, I think that I’m the one best able to run the race, win the race, and then do the job.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you. And speaking of just the types of issues that are being debated right now in a Republican-controlled House, and having seen Cooper go through that, I’m curious what your thoughts are on academic freedom. We’re a merit program scholarship. So what are your thoughts on how academic freedom is being negotiated, contested right now? And what would be your approach, and do you have any models for who you look to in terms of who’s doing it well?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*There are different places of academic freedom. There’s in our elementary schools and there’s in our universities. At the universities, obviously, it has to be a place where young people can wrestle with ideas. I mean, I think back, in fact, I did this exercise where I read some document that I wrote when I was 21, 22 years old last week, and honestly, I was mortified. Like, I couldn’t believe the tone. And generally I agreed with myself, but I’m like, “God, you thought you knew everything.” And I obviously did not know everything because I don’t know everything today. And so kids are searching to figure out who they are and what they truly believe. They’re wrestling with what’s my own view? What is my family’s view? What’s my neighbor’s view? What’s my community view? And so you got to give people the space to figure that stuff out, and colleges need to do that and really respect people who are searching. I think that it’s really important that politicians not try to control the academic tenor of an institution. And I’m really concerned with the way the governance of the university system is today. I feel like the legislature has their fingers much too in the day-to-day operation of the universities, and I think they’re really playing with fire, because when you look at what is a crown jewel institution in North Carolina, it is our public university system, it is our private colleges, it’s our HBCUs. And if they mess that up, they run the risk of messing up what has been an engine of economic growth in this state for the last 50 years.*

(Sarah)

*That resonates, because even this morning, this Food for Thought series, it came out of a desire to bridge divides, to have scholars talk about things from very different perspectives. And some of that is only possible when you can find safety in being able to change your mind, being able to hear from people who have drastically different life experiences and opinions. So, yeah, and being at UNC-Chapel Hill as well, we have to understand our positioning as a public university. So thank you for that. And Cate, I’ll hand it back to you.*

(Cate)

*How do you plan to address issues of affordability and accessibility for higher education in North Carolina, and what specific measures will you advocate for to reduce the financial burden on students and families?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*Well, one thing I’ve been doing is supporting efforts to improve public service loan forgiveness. This is a program that the federal government created a few years ago, 15 years ago, to encourage people to go into jobs that are sorely needed, teaching, law enforcement, first response, all these things that serve the public. And what the government said was, “If you do these types of jobs, we will—over a ten-year period, if you do it for ten years—we will forgive the balance, the outstanding balance of your loan.” But it has been incredibly poorly administered, and this is true under both Democratic and Republican Department of Administration. So this is not a partisan issue. But I want to thank President Biden because he’s trying to fix the problems of the past. And so we have been pushing and pushing to get that program to work so that people who have committed to public service can have their loans forgiven. The President has a loan forgiveness program for all students that is needs based. It’s not universal. It’s targeted to people who can best use it. Those policies are being challenged in court, and I’m in court trying to defend his right to come up with ways to make college more affordable.*

*I think, in particular in North Carolina, we have to try to contain tuition at the public universities and focus on driving down tuition for community colleges as low as possible, because community colleges are an incredible instrument of opportunity because they serve young people who want to go to college. They can go there for two years very affordably, build up some credits, and then transfer to UNC, UNCW, NC State, UNCG, any of these great schools, and be on their way in a very affordable fashion to get a college degree. But they’re also a way for somebody who is 40 and has just lost a job and wants to get new training in welding so they can go put up solar panel farms. And we have to be very aware that if the costs are too high, it’s going to be a barrier to people, and we really need to keep it affordable.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you.*

(Cate)

*What is your vision for the role of higher education in building a stronger and more equitable North Carolina, and how do you plan to collaborate with stakeholders across the state to achieve this vision?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*We have to create as much economic opportunity across North Carolina as possible. So a lot of parts of the state are thriving, parts of Wake County, the Triangle, parts of Mecklenburg County, the Triad, and then you’ve got Wilmington and Asheville. Those real estate markets are on fire. But these are a lot of times people coming in from outside who have resources, which makes it really tough on people who are living and working here. Then you have half the counties— North Carolina is one of the fastest growing states in the entire country over the previous decade—half of our counties lost population. It’s amazing. And that’s because there isn’t as much opportunity there. So, we have to be very aware of trying to spread economic opportunity more equitably across the state because if somebody wants to live in the community they grew up with and they’re going to work hard, they should not be limited. Their future should not be limited just because they want to stay in their hometown. But for a company to want to grow and succeed in a town, there has to be a hospital there, otherwise the managers and workers aren’t going to want to be there; there has to be good broadband there, or else they can’t compete against the businesses where they’re located in communities with high-speed broadband; there has to be good roads and railroads to move their products to market. So there are these basic investments we have to make. There have to be good public schools. You don’t want to go to an area, if you think your kid is going to be starting behind kids who are in Wake County or Durham County or Forsyth County or Orange County, then you’re not going to move your family there. And so we have to make sure that everyone has a chance.*

(Sarah)

*Last question.*

(Cate)

*How do you plan to address environmental issues in North Carolina, including climate change, air and water pollutants, and protecting natural resources? As someone from Wilmington, this is extremely important for me because we have a huge issue with PFAS in our water.*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*Yeah, I am very much aware of it. In fact, I’ve taken DuPont and Chemours to court for discharging Gen X, which is a PFAS, one of these chemicals that lasts forever, into the Cape Fear River for decades. And so I’ve taken them to court because I think they need to pay to clean up the mess they’ve made. There are too many people in southeastern North Carolina, hundreds of thousands, who are worried about drinking water from their home tap, and that is absolutely unacceptable to me. So clean drinking water, clean air to breathe, these are basic non-negotiables, and if companies are out there polluting those, they need to be held accountable and made to pay. On climate change, we are working on this issue on a host of fronts. We’re working at it at the Public Utilities Commission to come up with a clean power plan so that we can reduce carbon emissions by 70% over the next seven years, and that is absolutely doable, and I’m over there arguing vociferously for them to do more. We need renewable energy. It will both drive down carbon emissions, but it will also create this economic opportunity in rural communities that folks are desperate for. It adds to the tax base. Everything about it is a win-win. So there’s a lot we need to do, and I’m focused on trying to get it done.*

(Sarah)

*Josh, thank you so much for sharing. It’s great to hear this before the height of the race. And I wanted to ask, is there anything about you personally that you wouldn’t just be able to pick up from your online presence and things like that?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*I wish I were a more interesting person, but I’m pretty simple. I like walking our dogs with my wife. I love college sports. I’m a huge Carolina fan. Can’t tell anyone else that, but I grew up here in Chapel Hill, grew up in Charlotte, and then in Chapel Hill. So when you’re twelve years old, and you’re going to watch James Worthy and Michael Jordan playing Carmichael Auditorium, you’re pretty much hooked for life.*

(Sarah)

*Okay. Anything else you’d like to add for the Morehead-Cain audience that you’re about to speak to or the broader UNC-Chapel Hill community?*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*Well, it’s fun to be with college students. I have two of my own, one who just recently graduated, and I’ll sound like an old man, but every time my wife and I go visit our kids, we just say how much we love all the other students. Because young people are awesome, and they have so much energy, so much idealism, so much openness to what is next in their life because nobody knows. And I know that it’s not always easy to be a young person in these days, but I’m invigorated by being with young folks, so I’m excited to be here today.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you so much.*

(Cate)

*Yes, thank you so much.*

(Attorney General Josh Stein)

*Thanks. I appreciate y’all.*

## Episode Transcription

*Hello, everyone. Good morning. I see some movement. Before I start, I want to just share that I’m going to be talking about fertility in a bit. You’ll be seeing myself give myself injections, so if it’s triggering for anyone, I totally understand. If you want to get up and excuse yourself, that’s completely fine.*

*So when I got asked to give a SEVEN talk, I thought, “Why me? What am I going to talk about? What story do I have to share? I’m not a CEO, I’m not a published author, I’m certainly not the governor of North Carolina, so couldn’t they just call him?” But then I thought about the essence of seven, and I thought about Eve Carson, and specifically I thought about three days prior to her untimely death, or two days prior to her untimely death, I sat with her at a Morehead dinner, and I thought about how we talked, and we shared, and we talked about our lives and who we are as individuals—she a white woman, me a black woman. And I thought about what I would tell her now, what would I share with her now? So this is what I thought about.*

*For me, 24 was the number I was going to be married. I was going to have kids by 24. Fast forward ten years. I’m 34 now. I have no kids. I do not have a partner. I don’t really have plans to have kids in the next couple of years. But what I do have is I have a couple of eggs sitting in a cryogenic storage facility. So last year I started thinking about child rearing and the timeline we as women face. And I had asked a couple of friends, I said, “Have you thought about this?” And some of them said, “Yeah, I thought about it. I’m planning on having kids.” I thought about how easily friends got pregnant growing up. No problems, everything was an accident. But then, as I thought about getting older, I was like, okay, some of my friends are starting to plan on having families, and they’re thinking about starting getting pregnant, and some of them are having trouble. And fertility wasn’t a thing that came as easily. I started having friends who were using the term geriatric pregnancy. And I was thinking, “What does that mean? Like, we’re in our thirties.”*

*And so I learned that geriatric pregnancy, though an outdated term, is when a woman gets pregnant after the age of 35, and they’re considered high risk after the age of 35. And I just kept thinking, “Wow, that’s really young.” And as I learned in my research that geriatric pregnancy is an outdated term, so do not use that term anymore. We actually say “advanced maternal age,” advanced at 35. So I knew women were born with a fixed number of eggs, right? So that number decreases as we get older. Okay? But what I didn’t know is that the remaining eggs that we have start to potentially face issues. They might have abnormal chromosomes that could affect the viability of the egg or even the health of the child. So cue the anxiety at 33. As I said, I have no partner. I have no plans to have kids. I started to feel angst. What if I get married, and I want to have kids and I can’t? What if I don’t get married and I want to have kids and I can’t. Am I going to be too late? It was like someone turned on a timer, and it just started ticking every single day in my head. And every time I saw a mother or a child or someone pregnant, it was getting louder and louder and louder.*

*So at that point, I started to do some more research. I started talking to friends, and a few of them had learned about this egg freezing thing. I knew that people were talking about it. I had some friends that had completed the process, and I was surprised at how many people knew about this, quote, fountain of maternal youth, and hadn’t shared publicly. So I decided I would share publicly. First, I called my mom and I told her. My mom has been in the healthcare industry for her entire career. She’s a nurse, she teaches nursing. And neither of my parents had ever pressured me to have kids. They always said, “You know, live your best and fullest life, whatever path that takes you on, great. Grandkids, cool. If not, fine.” But when I call my mom, she was easily on board.*

*Great. This is awesome. Cool. Excited. Next, I share with my dad, and on the phone, my dad says, “Okay, baby, that sounds wonderful.” I have since learned, he immediately hung up the phone and called my mom and said, “Has she lost her ever-loving mind?” So he asked all the questions, “Is this safe? Is she going to be able to cover the cost for this and everything?” And I knew that what he really wanted to do was be 100% supportive to me on the phone. So he just knew he would call my mom.*

*Then I decided that I would tell all my friends on social media. And that’s when it started to dawn on me, the idea of maternal health, and specifically black maternal health. People asked a number of questions in my DMs. They asked me, “How much does it cost?” “Is your insurance covering it?” “What if you have complications?” “What if you find out you have some genetic factor that you don’t know about?” A lot of questions and a lot of fear came up. And a lot of fear, obviously, from a lot of my black friends, as black maternal health is something in a field that has been distrusted and disregarded as you think about women who have faced issues. We know about Beyonce; we know about Serena Williams, but what about me? So after my initial appointment… oh, sorry, to back up, I then decided that I would share with them, because a lot of them asked, “Can you continue to share your details? I want to know how this progresses on your journey.”*

*So I decided to share those as videos that will show behind you, but, support informative videos for my friends. I didn’t expect to be sharing this with you all today, so here we go. After my initial appointment, my doctor says, “It’s great. You’re a great candidate. You have a number of eggs for freezing, which on one hand is a good thing, but on the other hand could be a symptom of PCOS, which is polysystic ovary syndrome.” PCOS affects one in ten women of childbearing age and can cause high levels of androgens and many cysts on the ovaries. While my rare and high egg count was not a result of PCOS, I enjoyed doing the research and being able to inform friends about PCOS. When the medicines arrived at my house, the process got very real. I started the day after Thanksgiving last year, and while I was confident that I could administer the shots on my own, I asked a friend over for mortal support.*

*Using a syringe, I drew up the saline, and I mixed it with the powder that came in the little vial, and injected that into my stomach. I then used the Redi-ject pin to turn the dial and get the appropriate amount, and then injected that into my stomach as well. Luckily, I had a couple of friends who had done IVF, and they suggested that I alternate sides to keep the soreness down from the injections. The first week, I went to the doctor’s office every other day to have blood work and an ultrasound. And the office, while it was super inviting and the staff was multicultural, there was something that was a little off every time I went in. And what I realized is that, subconsciously, as I was looking at the promotional materials and the marketing materials, there were no black babies and no black mothers. And so subconsciously, I was asking myself, “Can I be a success story?” But it really made me double down on my need to tell people about this journey that I was on. So after the first seven days, the doctor started to change some of the dosage. On one particular night, I needed to take half of a dose, and I took astrology as my science with the lab at Carolina. So I needed to reach back all the way to, like, 10th grade chemistry to figure out how to half the dosage of this pre-filled vial. So about eight YouTube videos, two calls from my mom, called a fellow Morehead scholar, Jessica Lynch, who had done this process, and a few prayers later, I was able to administer the appropriate dosage. And the next day, the lab showed that my follicles were growing, and I had done something right. So, at some point, I started to become very cognizant of my ovaries. Never really felt my ovaries before, it’s always been great, but I started to feel a bit bloated in days, like walking around, bending over, doing normal activity, I started to notice they were noticeably larger. So I went to the doctor, and of course, he says, “Well, this is something called kissing ovaries. Your ovaries are actually large enough that they’re touching one another.” He suggested that I take it easy the next couple of days, and then we’re walking around in the Philadelphia streets, and so I did it as he suggested. The day before the retrieval, my mom came to town. So I thought this was really special to have my mom there as I took the next step of me potentially becoming a mom in the future.*

*The surgery was only about 45 minutes. I needed someone to drive me home after the anesthesia. That evening, the doctor called me and said that I had 26 eggs that he was able to extract, and 24 of those were viable. Now, if you remember in the beginning, I said 24 was the number that always was in my head. So it was very ironic and, in a sense, kind of full circle that I’m able to have 24 eggs on ice, and when I decide to use them, I can use them. I know that my biological clock is still ticking, but I also know that I was able to find freedom through my fertility journey and hopefully give you all some insight as well.*

*Thank you.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Cindy Parlow Cone, president of U.S. Soccer, on the historic agreements that achieved equal pay for women soccer players
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Cindy Parlow Cone, president of U.S. Soccer.

Cindy Parlow Cone, president of U.S. Soccer, spoke with the Scholar Media Team’s Laurelle Maubert ’25 and Content Manager Sarah O’Carroll before her Food for Thought talk this spring. On this episode, Cone shares about historic equal pay agreements she led as president, her goals for the federation, and advice for female college athletes.

Cone is the first female president of U.S. Soccer and the first former player of a senior U.S. National Team to serve in the role. She is also the youngest player to win an Olympic gold medal and a Women’s World Cup title.

In May 2022, U.S. Soccer, the United States Women’s National Team Players Association, and the United States National Soccer Team Players Association agreed on collective bargaining agreements to achieve equal pay for women soccer players.

## Episode transcription

(Sarah)

*Cindy, thank you so much for joining Catalyze today before your Food for Thought talk at the Morehead-Cain Foundation. We also have Laurelle from the Scholar Media Team, who’s excited to interview you. And Laurelle, I’ll hand things off to you now.*

(Laurelle)

*Awesome. Thank you so much, Sarah. So my first question for Cindy is, you became the first female president of U.S. Soccer in 2020, and you were also the first to hold the position who had previously played for a senior U.S. National Team. How have these two things made you such an effective advocate for the sport?*

(Cindy)

*When I ran for vice president, I did so because I really felt like it was important for a player to be in the room, or a former player—I wasn’t playing anymore, a former player to be in the room when decisions were being made about our sport. And so I put myself forward for the vice presidency. Little did I know, shortly thereafter, the president would resign, and I would immediately jump into the president position.*

(Laurelle)

*That’s awesome. Thank you. Next question. So the sort of subject of your Food for Thought talk today is equal pay for female athletes. And under your leadership, you negotiated a historic Collective Bargaining Agreement with both national teams that made the U.S. the first country to achieve gender equality. This has been a goal of past U.S. Soccer presidents but was never achieved. What do you think were both the actions and the characteristics of both you and others who are involved in this deal to help take it across the finish line?*

(Cindy)

*Yeah, so as a player, I was a part of the equal pay fight, so I’ve been in this equal pay fight for over 20 years. And I think coming into the presidency, I think finally there was someone in this position who really understood what the women were going to, why they were so angry and frustrated, because I was in their shoes. I was fighting their fight. And so to be able to be in a position to actually impact change was really important for me. And so, for me, I knew it wasn’t going to be easy. Look, it took me two and a half years as president to reach equal pay. So it’s not like I became president, and it happened overnight. There was a lot to be worked through. You know, negotiating one Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) is challenging. Negotiating two Collective Bargaining Agreements at the same time with a litigation in the balance because we had settled the women’s litigation. But in order for that settlement to go through, we had to figure out the CBAs for both the men and the women’s teams. And I give a ton of credit to my staff, to the women’s national team and their players association, to the men’s national team and their player associations, because we all got to together and figured out how to move forward.*

*And the process wasn’t simple. You feel like everything’s coming together, and then the next moment you feel like everything’s falling apart. And then everything starts to come back together, and then you’re like, oh no, it’s not going to work. But we kept coming back to the table. Everyone kept coming back to the table because we all wanted to figure this out and figure out the path forward. And I am just so excited about where we landed and the path that we’re moving towards.*

(Laurelle)

*Thank you so much. Next question is obviously so for this achievement, it was for U.S. Soccer, but do you hope that maybe seeing the US soccer team succeed in doing this that you can hopefully inspire other sports to do the same?*

(Cindy)

*Yeah, we all know that equal pay isn’t just a women’s soccer issue. It’s not just a women’s sports issue. It’s an issue in every industry. But what I’m excited about is not only what we’ve been able to accomplish here at U.S. Soccer with our men’s and women’s teams and their player associations, but we’re already starting to see the ripple effect of what we’re doing. And so I think that’s really exciting for all of us. And we know that not everyone around the world can do what we did in terms of reaching equal pay. But the important thing is that everyone continues to make progress, and we’re starting to see that ripple effect, which is really exciting.*

(Laurelle)

*There were many myths and misconceptions for a while of why equal pay for athletes was not possible. Obviously, this accomplishment for US soccer proves otherwise. But is there any one big misconception about why this couldn’t possibly be a possibility that you would like to debunk?*

(Cindy)

*I think there are a few things that I don’t know that they were like misconceptions, but just that people just didn’t understand. So one of the challenges to reach this is, for every game that U.S. Soccer controlled, so all the matches that we control and we get the revenue from, we had equal pay on. But the big discrepancy was the FIFA World Cup prize money. So during the litigation, it was looking at the 2018 and 2019 World Cups, where the 2018 men’s national team that won that received $40 million or 38, and then, the women’s national team in their World Cup a year later, the winner received $4 million. So massive discrepancies between what FIFA awards the men’s World Cup champion and the women’s World Cup champion. And so the challenge for U.S. Soccer was that, hey, we, we can’t make up that difference because we want our women to win every four years, and we can’t make up that difference every four years. And so the men had their Collective Bargaining Agreement, and the women had theirs, and they were not on the same cycle, so the men’s Collective Bargaining Agreement was up, so we would negotiate that. And then a couple of years later, the Women’s Collective Bargaining Agreement was up, so we would negotiate that. And so this kind of had an alignment of the stars, because while we had done some negotiating with the men’s national team on their CBAs, there wasn’t a CBA in place. So when the women’s national team’s CBA was up, we now had two teams that were out of contract. So my big goal was to put them all on one contract and have both players associations agree to one contract. We didn’t quite get there. There are differences between our men’s team and our women’s team, and they wanted different things, so we understood that. But as far as compensation, we were able to reach equal pay, including FIFA World Cup prize money. And I give a lot of credit to our men’s national team and their Players Association to coming on board to that, because any way you look at it, the men’s national team had to be willing to give up money in order for us to reach equal pay.*

(Laurelle)

*With this incredible victory for U.S. Soccer, particularly for female athletes now kind of complete and under your belt, what other initiatives and goals do you have for the sport that you hope to accomplish?*

(Cindy)

*Oh, man, so many. I think, first and foremost, to increase access to our sport. I want to change how people see our sport and see sports in general, honestly. If we change the way we think about it and think about soccer and sports as a birthright, how do we change how we go about it? And so, I really want to increase access. Obviously, I’m in the soccer industry, so specifically to soccer, I want to increase access to soccer. So we’re about to host the FIFA Men’s World Cup in ’26, alongside Canada and Mexico. And one of our big goals is to try to figure out a way to, anyone who wants to play our game can either walk, ride their bike, or take public transit to a safe place to play soccer. And soccer doesn’t have to be eleven per side on a beautiful green grass field. It can be two versus two in a backyard, it can be five versus five in a gym and futsal. So there are lots of different forms of soccer. But I really want to increase access to soccer, and not just access, but equal opportunity to succeed in our sport as well.*

(Laurelle)

*Thank you so much, Cindy. And thank you so much for being here this morning. We really appreciate it.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you. Cindy, anything else you’d like to share with the scholar community or perhaps even aspirational professional soccer players at UNC that you might have benefited as a student yourself?*

(Cindy)

*I think for me, the one thing that I wish I’d done a better job of was enjoying the journey. I was so goal-oriented and so intrinsically motivated that sometimes when I would achieve something, I would just move on to the next thing and didn’t really live in the moment and enjoy that milestone. And so I would say, enjoy the moment, enjoy the journey, even on the downtimes, really sit with that and think about it, and think about how 10, 15, 20 years from now, you’re going to learn from this experience and grow from it. We won the ’99 World Cup, and I didn’t even really celebrate. I was like, “Oh, the 2000 Olympics are right around the corner. I need to start training.” And so I think celebrating those milestones and then in those downtimes, taking those in as well and sitting with them. Whenever I had a downtime, I just kind of seem to ignore it and move on. But I think it’s important to really make sure we’re learning from those moments as well. So enjoy the journey.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you so much.*

(Cindy)

*Thank you.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Seniors Spotlight: Advice and reflections from Roli Enonuya ’23 and Maggie Helmke ’23
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Roli Enonuya ’23 and Maggie Helmke ’23 (Photos by Leon Godwin)

Maggie Helmke ’23 and Roli Enonuya ’23, two graduating scholars, joined Catalyze to reflect on their four years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Maggie and Roli share with scholar host Stella Smolowitz ’26 about their favorite classes and memories, challenges they overcame, and advice for incoming and current scholars. The seniors also share their plans following graduation on May 14.

[Listen to the episode](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/seniors-spotlight-advice-and-reflections-from-roli-enonuya-23-and-maggie-helmke-23).

At UNC–Chapel Hill, Maggie designed her own [C-START (Carolina Students Taking Academic Responsibility through Teaching) class](https://honorscarolina.unc.edu/academics/c-start/) about poetry, while Roli was involved in the [UNC Campus Y’s Helping Youth by Providing Enrichment (HYPE) program](https://campusy.unc.edu/committee/helping-youth-by-providing-enrichment-hype/), where she served K-5 students at local community centers through social, cultural, and educational experiences.

Following graduation, Maggie will take her Global Perspective summer through the Morehead-Cain, then pursue teaching. Roli will travel to Columbia and Brazil for her Global Perspective summer, then take a consulting role in Atlanta. (Both scholars’ final Summer Enrichment Program were delayed to this year due to the pandemic.)

At the end of the episode, other members of the Morehead-Cain Class of 2023 share advice, kudos, and college memories. Thank you to Charlotte Dorn ’23, Amy Feng ’23, McKenzie Martin ’23, and Kartik Tyagi ’23 for sharing your story!

# Episode transcription

(Stella)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Stella Smolowitz, from the class of 2026. Joining me today is Roli Enonuya and Maggie Helmke, both from the class of 2023. Roli is a political science and economics double major. At UNC, she was involved in Campus Y’s HYPE program, which provides social, cultural, and educational experiences for students at underserved community centers throughout the area. Maggie is a food studies and geology double major. At UNC, she enjoyed teaching a C-START class she designed herself about poetry. They are both graduating this year and have been reflecting on their time at UNC. Maggie and Roli, thank you for joining the podcast today. Can you tell me what you’re going to miss most about UNC?*

(Roli)

*Yeah, I’m going to miss a lot of things about UNC. I’m going to miss the community. I know it sounds cliché, but I haven’t really had a community feel like I have—being at UNC and being at the Morehead—I really do genuinely feel like I belong to something. And it’s scary going into the big world and not knowing where you stand. I’m definitely going to miss the community. I’m going to miss my friends. I’ve made really great friends here, and I’m just going to miss being a student because it’s a nice lifestyle.*

(Stella)

*Totally understand that. What about you, Maggie?*

(Maggie)

*Yeah, similarly, I am about to enter a bit of a period of transience, and I think I’ll really miss the constant availability of friends and support systems. It feels like wherever I walk on UNC’s campus, there is someone that I know that I get to have a conversation with and connect with, and that’s really beautiful, and I’m not really sure when I’ll have that next.*

(Stella)

*With this last month left of school, how are you spending your last moments as a senior on campus, and what are you most looking forward to?*

(Roli)

*I’m spending a lot of it just soaking up my last moments on this campus. I’m spending a lot of time with my friends. We hang out every day. I’m preparing for moving. I just rented a U-Haul, which is so scary. Yeah, I’m moving all the way to Atlanta. So, yeah, I’m just trying to sort out my future, get things down, but just soaking up what I have left of my time here because I’m really, really going to miss it.*

(Maggie)

*I have a bit of a crunch week this week, so I have a big paper and a couple of projects due. But in the midst of that, I’ve really been trying to soak up the sun, the spring in Chapel Hill is just amazing. So, spending time outside in the arboretum among the flowers and then also with friends. I love cooking with friends. So, convening over dinner, going to concerts at Cat’s Cradle, and trying my best to really remind myself of what I love about this place, and figuring out how to package up all those memories so that I can carry them with me onto the next step.*

(Stella)

*When you thought about yourself graduating a few years ago, did you picture yourself going into the field that you have chosen?*

(Roli)

*In terms of job field? No. I’m going into consulting. I didn’t even know what consulting was until I was a sophomore when I applied. I still barely know what it is. I think that nobody knows what it is. And in terms of majors, no, I’m an econ and poli sci double major. I changed my major, I think, nine times. Yeah, my academic advisor was absolutely sick of me, so I came in as global studies and then just switched it around a little bit for fun. I didn’t imagine being here, but it all worked out so perfectly. So, I would definitely encourage people to trust the journey because, yeah, I’m happy with where I ended up, and I didn’t have to overthink it too much. It kind of just naturally progressed that way.*

(Stella)

*Yeah. Maggie?*

(Maggie)

*Absolutely not. Coming into school, I wanted to be a criminal defense lawyer, which is a great profession and really important for social justice, but not something that is my strength. I can’t really sit at a desk for a super long time. I also similarly changed my major about a million times, and at one point, Chinese was in there, stats was in there. I was an English minor for a while, public policy major for a while, and then I eventually settled on designing my own food studies major and then returning to geology, which was actually, like, my first declared major. So, that was kind of full circle moment. But I think I want to be a teacher, an experiential education teacher. So that’s pretty different from law. But, yeah, I’m really excited about it, and I think it’s a good path for me.*

(Stella)

*I’m really glad you guys just both were able to find your paths, even though it took lots of turns. I think that’s really important. And now you both seem, like, very excited, and I could tell that you were glowing when you both talked about your future careers.*

*So, Roli, how has the Morehead-Cain Scholarship helped you get to that field and that passion? And how does it encourage you to do what you’re pursuing now?*

(Roli)

*I don’t really have the words to describe what the Morehead has done for me. I came from a working class background in England. And to those of you who know the Sutton Trust program, that’s how I got into the Morehead. And again, I will never be able to express the gratitude I have for both the Sutton Trust Fulbright program and for the Morehead. They just provide so much, the resources, the network, the advising, and things like that. And just providing a community of people you can rely on is something I’ve not had before. It relates to every part of my life, but in terms of my major and things and my career, just, for example, moving to Atlanta and going into consulting, there were like a few Morehead alums I was able to connect with. And it was just an instant, people wanting to be there for you and supporting you because they know how special and valuable this program is. So the Morehead has just provided me just so many platforms and so many connections that I would never have had access to, and it just got me into the room where it happened. So, I’m very grateful.*

(Stella)

*I’m wondering what your favorite class was, and what made it so great.*

(Maggie)

*My favorite class, I’m going to go all the way back to first year. I took Intro to Poetry Honors. I’d never written a poem before the class, so I was in a bit over my head. And I remember, the class was centered around workshopping, and I remember, the second workshop, we were going around talking about each other’s poems, and one kid looked at another student and said, “You know, the great thing about this poem is that there’s so much to cut,” which was so mean. And the rest of the class kind of moved along that trajectory, and it really forced me to learn how to take criticism and give criticism in a brutal and beautiful way. But it was a learning moment for sure. And I’ll always look back on it and remember some of the comments that were made about my poems and learning a bit more about writing. So, it was a really valuable experience and something I’ll never forget.*

(Stella)

*Was that a reason for you to go into the C-START and create that kind of track? And did you happen to talk to your professor from that class about creating the C-START class?*

(Maggie)

*Yeah. So I did the C-START. It was a poetry C-START about poetry of community with my friend who I met in the intermediate class, so the class after that, and we really got close within that class. Their name is Joe Snow, and they’re actually going to do it. It’s really cool. They’re going to go do their MFA in poetry. So that’s funny. And I wanted to create a low-stakes environment for writing on campus that included some of that workshopping that I got to do in the Intro to Honors class. But I think a lot of people stray away from taking writing classes because they feel like they’re not a good writer and might not get a good mark in the class. So my goal was to make poetry more accessible, lower stakes, something fun that people can come and build a community around once a week.*

(Stella)

*Thank you for sharing about that interest. Roli, what was your favorite class, and what made it so great?*

(Roli)

*I remember taking Policy 75 when I was a freshman. I was looking for anything to fill my schedule, and I just dropped it into my cart because someone, I guess, dropped the class. And I’m so grateful they did because it was such a great class. It was about racial inequality in the U.S. and the public policy behind it. And as an international student coming into the U.S., I would urge any other international to really take a class that examines the nation’s history, specifically as it pertains to race, because it has such a complex and honestly ugly history that I think it’s our duty to learn about. And it just really hit me, and it just taught me so much about the history of the U.S. and where people fit into it, where I fit into it. I took a class on the African diaspora, which taught me a lot about myself and how I identify. So, I’m just really grateful for liberal arts education. In the U.K., I would have probably just taken one course for three years and be done with it, but I’ve just learned so much about the world and myself through these classes, so I’m really grateful for that.*

(Stella)

*Awesome. You both touched on interests and classes that have nothing to do with your major, and I think that is so important. Are there any campus commitments that you found yourself very interested in, seemingly kind of out of the blue?*

(Roli)

*So you mentioned in my intro, I’m involved in HYPE through the Campus Y. I don’t do that for any other reason than I just love kids. It’s not to do with econ, it’s not to do with poli sci or consulting or anything. It’s just a nice way to spend my time doing something I really enjoy. I go there every Tuesday, and I just hang out with these kids, and they love it. They love having adults around that aren’t there for any reason but to just hang out with them and enrich their time if we can. So, yeah, that’s something I’m really glad I did because it’s got no academic or professional stake. I just enjoy it and enjoy spending my time doing it.*

(Stella)

Yeah.

(Maggie)

*I, kind of through a class, but I started volunteering in a local school garden, a middle school garden, and that was last year. And it’s been amazing spending time with kids. It’s such a refreshing “bubble-popping” event. “Bubble popping” referring to popping the UNC bubble. And the kids are so honest and fun, and I love building the garden with them and being outside. It’s really beautiful, active co-creation.*

(Stella)

*So you both are involved in, you just both talked about things that pop that UNC bubble, and go out and get involved in the Greater Chapel Hill/Carrboro community. Why do you think that’s important? And what are ways that maybe some other scholars could do that?*

(Maggie)

*It’s really important to pop the bubble because for the rest of our lives, we’re not going to be living in a bubble. We are responsible for approaching community in a way that’s very holistic and not—I think that the bubble can be really tunnel-vision inducing, and I think there are tons of ways to do that. There’s like, HYPE. There’s volunteering in local schools. They always—plug: Chapel Hill-Carrboro city schools always need teacher assistants and volunteers. Campus Y is amazing. Oh, my gosh, the Campus Y. I was also involved in Campus Y during my time here. And, yeah, that’s a great way to do it. There’s other ways, I’m sure.*

(Roli)

*I echo everything Maggie said. It’s just important to remove yourself from the bubble that you’re in and get into the real world because not the rest of the real world is a college town, which we forget sometimes. And you should also look into Student Life & Leadership. They have so many programs that will guide you if you are interested in getting off campus.*

(Stella)

*I’ll definitely have to look into those, those are great suggestions. While you both seem very successful and have gotten involved in these organizations that you love and are passionate about, we all know that failure is unavoidable. So what was your biggest challenge at UNC, and how did you overcome it? If you could go back in time, what advice would you give to yourself, or what advice do you have to scholars who may be experiencing similar dilemmas?*

(Roli)

*This is a bit of a cliché one because all Moreheads say this, but probably just failure. I was so bad at so many things, and coming in, obviously, where I’m from, we don’t have the whole liberal arts thing, so we don’t have to do, like, a history class from beyond the North Atlantic, random things like that. So I was just so bad at it, and I was like, “I hate this. Why am I doing it?” An example is like, I studied abroad, and I took a macroeconomics course, and I was so bad. And this is my major. Like, I need that course. I was so bad, my teacher told me to drop out. I was like, “No can do, I have to do this.” But I just persevered, honestly. I knew what my goal was. I knew I needed to get the class credit, and I just did what I had to do. I was resourceful. I knew I wasn’t necessarily good at math or academically, so I upped my grade in other ways. I was very very very vocal in recitations. I made sure I got my participation up, even if I was wrong. And I just encourage people to be bold and be loud, even if you’re wrong, because there’s no harm in effort. Effort goes a long way, and as long as you know what you’re trying to get and what you’re trying to aim for, and you’re audacious with it, normally you will get a good outcome.*

(Maggie)

*Yeah. My biggest challenge was in the spring of my junior year. So April, March of junior year, my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and I had a whole GP planned. I was just about to submit my application for GP, and I dropped that immediately. And he ended up, I spent the summer with him. He went to hospice, and I really spent my days reading and hanging out and just really being with him. And then he actually passed away first the first week of classes this year. And that, I mean, it was just, it’s been immensely challenging, navigating school with such an immense loss. And I think there’s really only one way to deal with such immense grief and sadness, and that’s to lean on the community, and give yourself space and grace to take time to heal. I was really fortunate to underload during the fall, which gave me a lot of time to cook and bake and go on long walks with friends, and I ended up deloading a lot of my school commitments, which was really hard to do. All of the things that I do, I really loved, but I knew that I couldn’t juggle everything, and I think just engaging in remembrance of my dad every day is something that also has helped me through and being really committed to honoring his memory and everything that he did to get me here. So, yeah, that was my biggest challenge.*

*I did fail as well. I talk about writing, and I love writing, and I just got rejected from the poetry program. I just got rejected, and dealing with that rejection was, there was nothing I could do. I ended up taking another writing class, which I was actually quite good at, so that was cool. And I had to be brave to reenter the realm of failure, but that was a major rejection, really. I had to pivot after that. I was thinking I was going to be a creative writing minor, and I was not; I was rejected.*

(Stella)

*Well, I appreciate you both sharing some hard but also really inspiring stories about how, of course, you seem very successful, but it definitely takes some failures and challenges to get through that, and I think the listeners will really appreciate hearing your stories.*

*So looking back at your four years at UNC, this is kind of a broad question, but what is a memory that stands out? Whether it’s crazy, funny, surprising, any of that?*

(Maggie)

*It’s a bit cliché, but last year, the Duke game, Final Four, the university and the town just came alive. I have never seen so many people running around Chapel Hill. It felt like everyone I’d known in my, I took a stop out, so in eight years at UNC, was suddenly back in town. It was awesome running into folks that you’d kind of vaguely known a few years before. And then when we actually won, I rushed Franklin Street, and I was quite close, and so I was one of the first people there, and there was just this massive crush of bodies. Everyone, the collective joy was electric. It was amazing. And I ended up getting access, like, we went on a rooftop to overlook everything, and it was just this undulating sea of Carolina blue. People screaming, chanting, crying of joy, of happiness. And it really reminded me how cool of a community Carolina is and honestly how awesome school spirit is.*

(Stella)

*So at your time at UNC, is there anything that stands out that is something or someone you are grateful for? Or where did you find your closest community at UNC?*

(Roli)

*Coming in, I remember me and all the Brits were asking like, “Oh, do you think you’ll be friends with other Moreheads?” And we were like, ”Nah, it’s probably not going to be the best way to find friends. Let’s branch out and see what else UNC has to offer.“ And funnily enough, two of my best friends are Moreheads. It didn’t even happen on purpose. They were actually just cool, and then we started hanging out, and now here we are really really really close. And we’re not friends just because we’re Moreheads, we have so much more in common than that, which is like a nice thing. It’s not like we all bunch together and only have this insular community, so I’m very grateful for them. My biggest community is probably my friends. I’ve never had a friend group that’s so close. We’re so cohesive, and we’re all as close to each other as one another, and I’m just really really grateful for that. I feel like when we move from here, I’ve got people in different cities I can reach out to and just, friendships where people value you for who you intrinsically are is just such a nice community to have on campus.*

(Stella)

*How are you planning on staying in touch with that close community when you all live in different places? I know you’ll be in Atlanta, and I’m sure not everyone will be there. So what are your plans for that?*

(Roli)

*It’s tough. We’ve all tried to commit to like a girls trip once a year, so hopefully I’ll see them there, running it back for spring break. But also just we have social media now, we have each other’s numbers, and flights are really cheap. We’re going to try and see each other as much as we can, and just staying in contact and keeping updated and making our relationships a priority is really important.*

(Stella)

*Awesome. That sounds great. Maggie, what is something or someone you are grateful for?*

(Maggie)

*Actually, two of my closest friends I met, one at Finals Weekend, Megan Lienau, and the other, Charlie Tran, I met on my NOLS trip. And the continued friendship has been really beautiful. I mean, we’ve watched each other grow up from little baby first years who had really no idea what we were doing, into almost full adult human beings who feel a bit more confident about moving throughout the world. And we’ve all gone through so much together, and it’s been so great to have people that know you and remember you and have seen you change. So honestly, a lot of radical change. And yeah, that continuation of support. I also have had really some really really supportive professors, one in my major of food studies. She’s really encouraged me to go into food and really cultivate that love for it. And I have a geology professor who’s awesome. His name is Drew.*

(Stella)

*You both talked about meeting friends even as early as Finals Weekend or your freshman year. So when you think back to your high school self during that time accepting the Morehead-Cain, what aspect of the scholarship were you not aware of but ended up benefiting from?*

(Maggie)

*I didn’t know that the building had unlimited tea and coffee, and I come here almost every day for my tea order, which I make myself of two hot cinnamon spice teas, oat milk, and a sugar packet. And it’s gotten me through a lot of tough times.*

(Stella)

*I definitely think the free coffee and drinks and tea is a great perk of the scholarship.*

(Maggie)

*Yeah, I love it.*

(Stella)

*I love it. So you both talked about your contributions at UNC and all of your, you talked about HYPE, and you talked about C-START. And I’m wondering, what contribution do you think you’ll be remembered by, or what are you most proud of during your time at UNC?*

(Maggie)

*I don’t really think I’m going to be remembered, and that’s okay. There are so many people at UNC who are always doing really amazing things, and I’m leaving, I’m graduating, and there’s going to be a new group of super awesome first years coming in next year. And, yeah, I don’t really think I’ll be remembered, and I’m very at peace with that. I think that’s a beautiful thing to recognize that our place here is transient, and we made the most of it and hopefully impacted some people for the better. But at the end of the day, there’s a continuous flow of people moving in and out of here. It’s powerful to think of yourself as, honestly think of yourself as small sometimes. I’m just like a small part of this really big community here, and I found my place here, and I hope others can do the same.*

(Stella)

*That was beautiful. Thank you for your answer. So, last question. Some of the listeners of this episode may be UNC students who still have time before they graduate or even incoming freshmen. What is the one piece of advice that you would give them?*

(Roli)

*I would say say yes to everything. Well, everything, not dangerous things, but say yes to a lot of things. I don’t know if it’s like the way I grew up or anything, I’m a bit of a homebody, naturally, and it’s easy for me to just want to be inside watching TV. But just saying yes and being bold and doing things I wouldn’t normally do has just opened so many doors for me. For example, I studied abroad in Singapore, which I haven’t mentioned, but it was one of the best things I’ve ever done. I would very very very much encourage UNC students to say yes to that opportunity. There’s just not really another time in your life where you’ll get the chance to study in another country for five months or just live in another country for five months with such low stakes. I went to Singapore and had the best time, and even while out there, I did things I wouldn’t ever, ever thought I would have done. I thought I was going to stay in Singapore for five months and come home, but I met some wild and fun and incredible people, and next thing you know, I was on a remote island in Cambodia, and I was just having the greatest time and just saying yes to things. And it just opens doors and helps you meet people that just expand what you thought was possible in the world.*

(Maggie)

*I think this kind of goes back to the last question about what I’m proud of. A few months before my dad passed away, we were driving just down a road in Tampa, and he has two sets of children, so he has four kids, and he said, “I’ve raised kids 30 years apart, and I never wanted my kids, I never needed my kids to make a lot of money or be influential. Really, my main goal was to raise curious children, and I’m really proud that I’ve done that.” And I think that is the thing that I’m proudest of, is that I’ve cultivated curiosity, and that’s my biggest piece of advice to incoming students is hone in on that. Let yourself explore. Let yourself do things that might not align with your major, might not align with anything, you just think that they’re awesome and want to try it out. I mean, I took a class on mushroom foraging through the Lovelace fund, and that’s really changed my outlook on life. Find something fun and funky. Find something that you’re not going to put on your resume that you’re curious about. Mine was making recipes for different types of cookies, tampering away in my little kitchen with different types of flour, different sugars. I’ve been doing that actually since high school, but I got really into it in college. Yeah, do something you love, something that really lights your fire.*

(Stella)

*Awesome. So, listeners, say yes to everything, and find something fun and funky. Thank you guys for listening to Catalyze. I’m Stella Smolowitz from the class of ’26, and that was Maggie and Roli from the class of ’23. You can let us know what you thought of the episode by emailing us at [communications@moreheadcain.org](mailto:communications@moreheadcain.org) or by following us on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook at morehead-cain. Thank you for listening.*

(Charlotte Dorn ’23)

*My advice would be that you should listen to your gut and to your body. And if you’re not in touch with your intuition yet, then you should really take the time to investigate what brings you joy and what brings you enthusiasm, and then really follow that passion and listen to that. Oh, and take care of yourself.*

(Amy Feng ’23)

*My name is Amy, and one person I’m grateful for is Tess McGrinder. She is my best friend and also part of the class of 2023. She always inspires me to be kind and wholehearted in everything that I do and always makes me feel better when I’ve had a hard day.*

(Roli)

*My favorite experience was studying abroad and just going to a place I never imagined going to. And that was all facilitated by this scholarship, which I’ll be forever grateful for.*

(McKenzie Martin ’23)

*I was on the all-scholar NOLS trip the summer before my freshman year, and I’m continually astounded by how close I’ve stayed with the six girls on that trip. So to Noor, Mabel, Miranda, Naomi, Tyla, and Eleanor, thank you so much for your friendship, and I’m so glad to have shared these four years with you. Love you guys.*

(Kartik Tyagi ’23)

*I’ve come to appreciate what it means to chart your own journey, to find what it is I’m really, truly passionate about, and with everything I’ve got, to go for it, to do so with the support of an entire community behind me, that of the Morehead-Cain network.*

## Episode Transcription

(Benny)

*Welcome to Catalyze. I’m your host, Benny Klein, from the class of ’24. Today’s guest is former San Francisco Giants general manager Bobby Evans from the class of ’91. He stopped by the Foundation last May during his father-son college tour of UNC. Bobby shares stories about his grandmother’s paradigm shifting advice, sneaking into the UNC versus Duke basketball game at Cameron Indoor Stadium to cheer on the Tar Heels, the changing landscape of professional baseball, and his people-first approach to building effective teams. Bobby Evans is a veteran major league baseball executive. Over the course of 25 years, Bobby advanced from being a minor league administrative assistant to serving as the franchise’s senior vice president and general manager. During that time, he helped the team reach seven postseason appearances and three World Series championships. Now Bobby serves on the National Leadership Council for the Positive Coaching Alliance and works with Because Baseball, a nonprofit founded by Kemp Gouldin of the class of ’02. Based in Cairo, Egypt, they aim to build bridges of friendship in the Middle East.*

(Benny)

*All right, Bobby, thank you so much for talking with me today. I’m really excited to get to chat.*

(Bobby)

*My pleasure. Good to be with you. Beautiful day in Chapel Hill. Can’t beat it.*

(Benny)

*Yes, sir. It’s getting hot on campus, but as expected. I’d love to start off, you were born in New York, but you are from Jackson, North Carolina. And what was it like transitioning from New York to Jackson?*

(Bobby)

*Well, so I was born in New York, but we moved a couple of times. Once, when I was about nine months old, from New York to Walnut Creek, California. And then, when I was about two and a half years old, we moved to Framingham, just 20 minutes west of Boston. So we were in Boston, just outside of Boston, until I was nine years old. So it really created this passion for sports, all the Boston sports. And so the move to North Carolina was actually harder than I expected. I’ve always been one who embraced change, even as a young boy. But when we got to North Carolina, and I realized I couldn’t watch any Celtics games, any Red Sox games, any Bruins games, or Patriot games, and it was just like I felt lost all of a sudden. I think my attachment to New England became even stronger because I was away from all those sports. I was a part of a small town of about 700, I think. Now it’s even smaller.*

*But in fact, while I’ve been here in Chapel Hill, I went back to Jackson just this weekend, and I met up with a couple of classmates, one in particular, who right after I got there in the third grade, he came up to me, and I teased him about this the other day. “You came up to me,” I told him, I said, “Doug, you walked up to me and said, ‘Hey, Al and I are coming to your house today to play football.’ And I was like, ”Okay.” And Doug was like, the biggest kid in class. And so you weren’t going to argue with Doug, but as a kid, just the embrace of one of your classmates like that. It was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. But I didn’t really appreciate Jackson initially because I was so stuck on what I was missing from New England. And I went to the Hugh O’Brien Leadership Conference as a sophomore in high school, and at that leadership conference, they began interviewing candidates for the national conference. And so at the national conference, I was told I’d be representing the state of North Carolina, if you get selected. I ended up one of the finalists. They interviewed me. I ended up not getting it. And my dad came to pick me up that day at the end of the conference in Charlotte and take me home. And he had my grandmother, his mom, with him. And she began asking me about the conference, and I told her about the finals and that I was a finalist for the Leadership National Program and some of the questions they asked me and what I answered, and she became very agitated. And she was just like, she doesn’t get angry ever, but riding in the car, she’s getting really upset. And she turned in her seat, and she said, “Do you realize that every question they asked you, you answered with something about Boston, Massachusetts, Red Sox? You understand you now are in North Carolina, but your roots are in North Carolina. You’re from North Carolina. Your mom and dad met in college in North Carolina. You need to take some pride in where you’re from.” And it struck me so significantly that when I went back for my junior year of high school, I was just totally invested in the people. I already loved my friends and our school, but it created a deeper passion for North Carolina, Northampton County, Jackson, and I really invested in leadership. And ultimately, my senior year, I became student body president and invested even more with great people, great friends, and student council members around me.*

*And in 2014, when we had our third child, I named him Jackson. In many ways, I was honoring two very deep loves for me. One, the town of Jackson, because of all that they mean to me. But then my grandmother, who spoke into my life in a way that made me appreciate and began to love what I already should have loved, but in a deeper way. And so therefore, Jackson represents my love for North Carolina, Jackson, and Northampton County, and my grandmother. So the transition was hard as a boy, but with that wake up call, I figured it out in the end.*

(Benny)

*And sticking with the theme of transitions, what was it like going from a town of 700 people to being a Morehead-Cain scholar at the University of Chapel Hill with 20,000 people?*

(Bobby)

*Probably more challenging than the number of people were the number of opportunities. I mean, there was an overflow. When you come on campus here, there is an overflow of opportunities. And when I was a freshman, I was very focused. I was a student, I was going to find a church family, and I was going to be involved in baseball. So it wasn’t very complicated for me when I first got here. Those are my three focuses.*

*The baseball was very demanding. As I tried out for the team and didn’t make it, I asked to be a student manager, and I was successful at getting that. And the student manager job was just pretty involved, very time consuming. And so between the academics and the investment of time in baseball and a local church, University Baptist on the corner of Columbia Street, that’s where I dedicated my time. But it was after leaving the student manager position my sophomore year and joining club baseball that I found time was on my hands more than ever. And I began really trying to figure out where do I invest, where do I invest my time, because there’s only so many classes and only so many elements of study that you need to do in your your non-classroom time. And so I needed to find a home base of investment of other things. And so that became really the more challenging, because I never had so many opportunities staring at me. And you certainly have opportunities in high school, but in a small town and small county, nothing like I was getting in Chapel Hill.*

(Benny)

*And I know you, like you said, were playing club baseball for UNC. I’m curious where the deep passion for baseball comes from? And then obviously we know now that your career went in that direction, but I’m curious if you had confidence then that that’s where you’d end up, or were you exploring other career options, or how did you come to that decision?*

(Bobby)

*Well, as a boy watching all the major sports of the time, football, hockey, basketball, and baseball, baseball just had a unique tug at my heart, and I think some of it was organic. And I had an older brother who collected baseball cards, so I course collected baseball cards. My mom and dad were passionate baseball fans. In fact, when they got married, my dad graduated from the dental school at Carolina, my mom graduated from Meredith, and when they got married, they went to a double header in Washington on their honeymoon. Their passion for baseball was pretty evident.*

*But as a kid, all I ever dreamed of was playing in the big leagues. I was a big fan of Carlton Fisk. I wanted to be a catcher, and I guess I was probably eight years old when a player from the New England Patriots came to my church and spoke. And it was the first time I’d ever seen my church full, and it’s in Sudbury, Massachusetts, which, Sudbury is where Babe Ruth lived when he played for the Red Sox back in the whatever ’20s or pre-’20s. When I saw my church full, and I saw John Hannah speaking, who was a member of the New England Patriots, it really impacted me. I was like, I could live my dream, play baseball, and make an impact, maybe an impact like John Hannah. And so I prayed at that moment. I prayed, I said, “God, if you put me in the big leagues, I’ll dedicate my career to you like John Hannah.* *I’ll make an impact.” And so as a kid, that was just my heart’s dream. And I played baseball growing up, and we moved from Massachusetts to North Carolina. I continued to play baseball and got to high school, play baseball. In fact, yesterday I had an opportunity to have dinner with my high school baseball coach. I drove down to Wilmington, North Carolina, and met him where he was able to drive up and connect. And we just talked about all the great memories of playing under him and with him and his dedication to us. He was our calculus teacher, so it was very important that we got our work done.*

*But when I got to college, I thought I’d walk on at Carolina. I’ll be honest, I really didn’t understand what Division 1 athletics meant. I just thought, “Yeah, I’m going to Carolina. I’ll walk on.” And I quickly found out two or three whatever workouts into it that I wasn’t going to make it. I remember looking at my name on that list. I can still see myself staring at that and thinking it’s got to be a typo. There’s got to be more opportunity than this. Then I went in and talked to the coach, and he said to me, “Bobby, as we evaluated you, you’re average in every category, and average is good, but we need more above average skills in at least one or two areas.” And I ultimately asked him if I could be a student manager, and he said yes. But as I grew up in the game professionally, I learned that that’s a really nice way of saying you’re not good enough. You’re very average in a lot of areas. So it was very humbling. It was very humbling, but it was a good wake up call. But my dream was still, I still wanted to play in the big leagues, but I thought being a student manager, I could throw batting practice, hit fungos. Maybe I’d get a chance to hit BP. Maybe I’d impress, maybe I’d grow stronger.*

*So my sophomore year, I went and played summer ball before my sophomore year in Daytona Beach with the Daytona Beach Dodgers in this Central Florida baseball league. And I thought I’ll come back ready to compete. That was my hope.*

(Benny)

*Yeah, and I know you know better than anyone else just how hard it is to make it, whether that’s Division 1 or to the show itself. It’s impossible, really.*

(Bobby)

*Well, it’s incredibly difficult. And I think one of the benefits of youth is we don’t always understand how far it takes to get to that level. And I think that’s one of the benefits, is being naïve, but also being willing to work hard. And even as I talk to my 17-year-old son, who’s playing in high school, and he’s trying to be very realistic about his future in baseball, I tell him, “Hey, you never know how you might grow, how you might develop, what opportunities might come. Keep working at it. Keep pushing.” And I always tell kids, “You be the player and let the scouts be the scouts. Don’t try to be your own scout. Let scouts tell you whether you’re good enough. You just focus on working hard at it.”*

(Benny)

*Absolutely. And if you could give me some favorite Chapel Hill memories, whether that’s in the classroom, socially, or with Carolina sports, you pick.*

(Bobby)

*Well, one of my favorite memories actually hit the highlight reel this year in Chapel Hill because forgive me for not remembering whether it was 1990. I think it was 1990. Carolina was not doing particularly well, and Duke was ranked, I think, number one in the country. And they’re playing at Cameron Indoor Stadium. So I was like, I want to go see that game. So I had a car on campus. I think I was a junior. And so I drove over to Cameron Indoor, and I saw all these students camped out, and I was like, so I asked them, I was like, “What do you guys do?” And they like, when whatever time comes, 6:00 comes, we all just line up, and we show our ID and go in.“ I was like, ”Okay, great.“ So I take off, come back to campus, do whatever I got to do, keep watching my watch. And I’m like, okay, it’s getting close. So I go back. I go back to Cameron. It’s about to be 6:00. I park my car. I see everybody’s starting to gather up to get in line. I just jump in line.*

*And when I got to the door, they were checking IDs. I just flashed my Carolina ID. But the guy that was checking IDs got distracted by the person in front of me because they had this big gaudy sign. And they’re like, you can’t bring that in here. And while he was fussing at them, you’re already seated. I was already walking in. And so when I got in, I sat in the student section behind the basket, and I screamed my head off for two halves of basketball in which Carolina just crushed the Blue Devils in a historic win. I went alone. And the guy who sang the national anthem, at one point, well, there was a guy, someone sitting near me said, “Hey, when you’re screaming, you got to scream with more bass in your voice because you’re going to hurt your lungs, because it was pretty exciting. I realized it was the guy who sang the national anthem, so good advice, but it was a historic win, and we got to see some replications of that this year, which was fun, but one of my favorite memories.*

(Benny)

*It was a blast this year in Chapel Hill for sure. If we could move on to the start of your career. I know you worked in the commissioner’s office. I’m curious what it was like getting that early exposure and how, if at all, it set you up for the rest of your career?*

(Bobby)

*Being a part of the Morehead-Cain process and being a finalist for an interview. So I ended up as one of nine finalists for this job in the commissioner’s office, and there was obviously really good candidates. Again, I think that being from a small town in North Carolina, I tease people and say that at some level I wonder if they hired me just because they wanted to see if a kid from a small town in North Carolina could make it in New York. Because my interview was very organic, it wasn’t anything dramatic about it. They did ask me a lot about the town of Jackson. They were like, “So do you have a sheriff in town that pulls people over?” And we have no stoplights. We have one yellow blinking light. And I said, “Well, we have Sheriff Willard, who, if you speed through town, he’ll grab you. And in fact, he pulled over Jim Valvano not long ago because he was going to Chowan College, I think, to scout some players.” And so they all laughed, and it was just a very relaxing interview. But part of what made it relaxing is they were asking me about where I was from. So, again, Jackson played a role probably even in that opportunity.*

*But when I got the opportunity, it was one of those things where it was just pedal to the metal, just try to learn as much as I could. I was in the baseball operations department of the commissioner’s office, where we were trying to prepare for the baseball draft. We were overseeing the transactions of major league and minor league players, and we were looking at the baseball rules and the facility quality of the facilities, the tobacco policy in baseball, at that time. Magic Johnson was diagnosed with HIV or HIV positive, and so we began an education program to help players understand what that meant for the clubhouse and how you needed to be more careful about sharing razors and things like that in a clubhouse. And we had doctors and specialists to try to guide us. But the opportunity just gave me interactions and context with every major league club, and I was able to see kind of which clubs were uniquely good or uniquely struggling or seemed to be led by people with a strong presence or people that were uncertain about how I would fit there.*

*And so when my boss always encouraged me, at some point, “Bobby, you want to get with a team.” Well, I had worked for the Red Sox, so of course I wanted to work for a team. When opportunities came and went, I interviewed and talked with teams, but one opportunity really stood out, and it was an opportunity with the San Francisco Giants. Just because coming from Chapel Hill, and now living in New York City, which New York City is I think it was one of the things that John Motley Morehead said in his speech. I don’t know if you’ve seen the speech that he gave the 1957 class at Carolina. It’s titled “That’s That.” And in that speech, he talks about how when you graduate, go move to a big city. Work in a big company where you can grow. I was living in New York City, so I didn’t really want to go from New York City to a smaller city. But I just wanted to make sure if I was going to go to a major league city, I wanted to be sure it was a strong major league city and a city with major league history, with baseball history. And for the Giants, it was just a great fit because they had come from New York. San Francisco was such an incredible city. In fact, when I got the job with the Giants, after interviewing and going through their process, people came up to me left and right. San Francisco is my favorite city, my favorite city, my favorite city. And I had spent very little time in San Francisco, and I see why now, after 26 years, why it’s people’s favorite city.*

(Benny)

*It checks out.*

(Bobby)

*It does.*

(Benny)

*And how arduous and grueling was your work in the minor leagues? So I grew up in Durham, went to Durham Bulls games all the time. That was one of our favorite things to do as kids. But I know how tough that system is. You don’t get paid well, you’re on the road. But what was it like in the office side of that, was it as tough as it is on the players?*

(Bobby)

*Well, I was 25 years old, and I was tasked with replacing a longtime assistant director of player development, and I was also tasked with the fact that the Giants had been just purchased a year earlier. And so there was still a lot of new beginnings for this new ownership in terms of how they wanted to conduct business and how they wanted to manage their player development. And Brian Sabian at the time was my boss. He had expectations coming from the New York Yankees of what he wanted to see. And I had a Jack Hyatt, who was originally with the Giants in the ’60s and had now taken over as the head of player development in the late ’80s being a part. Their experience and expertise were really pillars for me to learn from and places for me to depend on how to manage agents, how to manage player contracts, how to manage, and I’m 25. Tony Siegel was the assistant GM at the time. And so they had very clearly defined expectations and guidelines as to what they needed me to do in terms of really running the operations of the minor league system, travel, and making sure we had a good guy running our equipment and doing our travel and building relationships with the minor league affiliates.*

*So it was a nonstop job. In fact, I worked so many hours as a single guy, moving to a city, I was just able to just work nonstop. And in the process, I was able to build systems and processes that were maintainable and manageable for a much more normal workload and just take on more and more things. But the strike hit in 1994, and Tony Siegel, our assistant GM, left to go to the Rockies. And when he left to go to the Rockies, a lot of his responsibilities poured into my lap administratively, which really allowed me to set up more systems and more processes that even have impacted our major league operations. So at 25 years old, I’ve got my hands full. And baseball, you could work in baseball for ten or 15 years and never get the responsibility that I got in nine months. And it was, it was incredible education by fire. And I was strong administratively and strong operationally. So I was able to take the lead on a lot of different things, and it grew over time. But I began to learn in that process how to care for our players, how to care for our coaches, how to care for our scouts, how to care for our major league personnel, how to care for our major league players, their families, and in the process, developed systems and processes that would make our organization first rate in terms of our care and treatment of our guys, and make sure that we eliminate distractions for our players so that they can perform the best on the field, and whether that’s a simple thing like getting approval from ownership to give a bonus to a player who had a great season, first half of the season, but didn’t make the All-Star team, but still give them a bonus. Or give a player that made the All-Star team that didn’t have a bonus in this contract, still give them a bonus. Or asking ownership to let me have permission to fly a player’s family to San Francisco when they get called up for the first time so that they can be there, in fact, including flying the scout that signed them there as well for that moment. So a lot of things just to really understand what motivates your people, what keeps people focused on doing their best work. And one of the things that’s very distracting for players is in the minor leagues, the lower level minor leagues baseball, the AAA, you get promoted, you get a phone call, and you’ve got to go back to your hotel room or back to your apartment, pack it up, and get on a flight in no time, because we need you in the lineup right now.*

*And so that can be very difficult for players. And invariably I’d be calling a player and let him know, and he’d say, “Well, my girlfriend just got here from Idaho, and what am I going to do?” And so I learned quickly that ownership was behind me to allow that player to fly her with them and make it easy for him. Don’t create more costs for them. Help them, reimburse them for the remaining portion of the rent that they had to give up. We just cared about our guys, and we felt like that gave them the best chance of success. But the minor leagues is always tough. We had to help our minor league affiliates understand that if you’re going to save money, never save money on the bus. Make sure you have a quality bus. I can’t afford for our players to get stuck somewhere and be stuck on a bus for hours in the heat, that’s not good for them physically or mentally or performance wise. We need to have travel arrangements that give them the best chance of performance. Go a day early on the road. Don’t always wait until the day of. And we just tried to get our affiliates to invest more in their facilities, their batting cages, their fields. I gave them a list of slam dunks. If you’re a minor league affiliate of the Giants, you’re going to have a field that’s in excellent condition and always available. You’re going to have a batting cage that’s in excellent condition and always available. You’re going to make sure that you take care of our guys on the road. You have hotels that are slam dunks. These are slam dunks. If you’re going to be an affiliate of ours, our guys got to be in the right hotel. They have to have the right bus, and, and we’ve got to make sure that the housing in the community is sufficient for them. And so a lot of our affiliates created family housing, which is at little or no cost to the player, which made things more tenable. And as we see now in the minor leagues, I love the fact that the minor leagues have a voice now, even if it’s just through social media, but just to be able to communicate the nature of the accommodations or situations that they’re facing so that they can get better. We always tried to go above and beyond, but even looking at what we did, it still needed to evolve into more. And I’m thankful to see it’s continuing to evolve into a better situation.*

(Benny)

*Thank you for listening to Catalyze. I’m your host, Benny Klein. This interview wrapped early so Bobby could regroup with his son, who was touring campus that afternoon. I had the chance of catching up with Bobby later on Zoom, where we continue the conversation about his career with the Giants. That’s up next.*

*Okay, so I think when we left off, we were talking about your career in the minor leagues and how quickly you kind of moved up the institutional ladder. I’d love to ask, what was it like when you got the call or were first told you were going to be the general manager, and what was the best piece of advice you received when you first stepped into that role?*

(Bobby)

*I mean, it was a long time in the organization, and I tried to never really focus on anything other than the job at hand. It became tempting at times to get concerned because oftentimes I felt like I had a role that didn’t necessarily match the title. But I didn’t let that worry me too much. I just tried to focus on the job at hand. The goal was never to become any one position. The goal was just to try to be a part of a winning organization and make an impact in the league and ultimately win the best prize of all, which is the World Series. And we got to the World Series four times, and then we won it three times. And during the World Series in 2014, I got wind that there was a possibility that I could be named the general manager for the start the following season. I was certainly excited about that, but I think the greater excitement just came in us winning and just the combination that we had built. We’d built such a great team. Nobody trying to get each other’s job, everybody working so well together. It felt good to get that acknowledgment, particularly from my boss, who was the general manager and then ultimately also our owner or president, team president, as well, and the ownership group as a whole. So it felt very affirming. It was a great moment. The conversation was initially first through our general manager, and then followed by the team president, and then followed by a press conference. So in about 72 hours, it kind of got thrust towards that. We were coming off of winning the World Series, and the team was one we’d worked on all winter, but it didn’t feel immediately any different. I mean, I think we were trying to operate as we always did, collaboratively. Yeah, I felt the weight of the responsibility because I think our general manager, my longtime boss, was trying to back away, but then he would also try to balance being involved. He wasn’t being paid to be uninvolved. He was just backing away a little bit. So it was just a dynamic, and the difference was very challenging, I think, for both of us. But I was excited to get that opportunity. I think, again, there’s only 30 of those jobs, and so I certainly have to be thankful for the opportunity.*

(Benny)

*Sure. How do you manage the emotions of that responsibility? You have an entire fan base and are in a position that, fairly or unfairly, is often judged based on wins and losses.*

(Bobby)

*You try to never get too high or too low. I mean, having come off a World Series in 2014, before there’s a parade, you also start working on the next season. So you just can’t get too high. You enjoy the moment and you try to get the most out of it, but you also realize that you’re on the team bus following the parade, and you got some of the players on the bus, and some of those players are free agents, they’re arbitration eligible or trade candidates. And you immediately forget about the parade even, you just start thinking about, okay, what’s the status of this player’s contract? What can we do to keep him? What are we going to do if a trade opens up here? So your mind just starts racing. And as much as you’re attentive to the excitement or the expectations of fans, there’s a lot of internal expectations too. And those internal expectations, you’re with them every day. You’re with them every offseason, every season, every game day. Those expectations are so forefront of your mind. You have a Buster Posey on the team. He expects to be on a team that’s going to win. I mean, you have a Bruce Bochy who’s won 2000 games in the big leagues. I mean, he expects to win. You have a coaching staff that has helped us win three times. You have a scouting staff, a player development system that’s expecting players to come up through the system and get opportunities. There’s scouts that are finding players that expect us to put the money behind signing them. You’ve got, you know, players that have expectations of playing time, of opportunity, of certain roles, of a certain place on the team. There’s so many expectations. The only way, you as an individual can’t manage all those expectations alone. You put core leaders in place to help guide each of those expectations, each of those areas of need and expectation to be as fruitful and as productive and as effective as possible. It’s very important not to feel the weight of the world on your shoulders alone, because no one person can manage all of that. You put good people around you.*

*Unfortunately, over 20 plus years, Brian and I had brought so many great people to the organization that we felt very supported in our given roles and our responsibilities. As the expectations grow externally from fans or season ticket holders or both, you understand, I mean, you get it. But those expectations are just along with so many others. And you have a lot of expectations of yourself. I mean, you have expectations of what you can do. But the reality is there’s only so many things you can control. So you have to get your rest at night, and you have to put today behind you and look towards tomorrow when things don’t go your way. In a successful season, you’re guaranteed to lose at least 60 games, right?*

(Benny)

*Exactly.*

(Bobby)

*So you can’t get too high or too low, but you definitely ride the wave when the team is going well, and you feel the pain of it when it’s going bad. And you never know when you lose three in a row, are you going to lose four in a row, or can you swing back and win three or four more? So you do get on that bumpy ride during the season, but part of the discipline of being in the game for a long time is learning how to not get too caught up in the ups and downs and try to remain steady. Smile at your staff the morning after a loss. You don’t have to play the grumpy role. I’m grumpy today. We lost. Don’t smile. I get that. I mean, maybe after a game in the clubhouse, that’s a given, but back to the office the next day, you got to move on.*

(Benny)

*My high school coach’s term was “flush it, move on.” You mentioned all the people that it takes to be successful. I’m curious, what are some of the intangibles that you look for in recruiting talent, both with players and staff and in business more generally?*

(Bobby)

*You need a certain level of expertise. You need a certain level of competence in the role. In this game, experience can play a significant role, too. But really having all of that doesn’t matter if you’re not a good communicator, if you’re not able to communicate internally and work with others, a good team player, you’re looking for leadership. You’re looking for leadership potential. You’re looking for skills that will translate to helping put together a roster and putting together a department, putting together a budget, putting together a plan, a strategy. People that are good at executing that strategy, people that are good at evaluating, not only evaluating talent on the field, but evaluating talent to add to their team, to their department so that there’s a constant flow of talent evaluators, talented talent evaluators, talented front office people, and talented coaches, talented scouts to help develop and find talented players. So those are some of the skills you’re looking for. I mean, it’s not any one thing.*

(Benny)

*My brother’s, my dad, and I love the movie Moneyball. And could you give me a letter, grade A to F on how well they do in representing the role of general manager? Is there a little part of you that wishes Brad Pitt was playing you in a movie like Moneyball? And part of this game for those 25 years when it seems like the stats era came about? So could you talk a little bit about how that changed your perspective on the game?*

(Bobby)

*A lot of the scouts had a different impression of what the numbers were saying. Their evaluation of a player might not match exactly what they were, exactly what the numbers were saying. And so that created some frustration at times, but it became part of our journey, part of our decision-making process. And in the early 2000s, we didn’t have an experience exactly like the A’s, in the sense that we were trying to put our team together with the best information available. But our 2002 team, which is very similar to the A’s in the book, Moneyball, also had a very good team. We were probably more offensive in 2002 than we had been in a while. Our pitching was very good. I think in the book it doesn’t give enough credit, probably, to the A’s pitching. Barry Zito and Molder and other guys that were just significant parts of, Tim Hutton. I mean, just parts of that club. But we were all going through it. We were all going through the transition to more information being available, and how do we digest it, and we worked hard to do that. And I think that our success in the long run was because we balanced all of the new information, all the new technology, without discounting the value of the Scouts and their observations and their experience, which I give our scouts a lot of credit in being more open to the information that was coming into the pipeline than maybe other teams or maybe than other teams realized scouts could be open to. And it ultimately worked to our advantage. I think a big part of the reason we won three in five years was because of the collaborative effort of everyone, not discounting anybody’s contribution.*

(Benny)

*I’d love to move on to the state of the game today. Could you give me your perspective? I know that Don Mattingly, the Marlins manager, recently said, he called baseball unwatchable sometimes because nothing goes on. And I don’t necessarily agree with that assessment, but critics are certainly pretty loud these days on the state of the game. So what’s your take?*

(Bobby)

*The game has always been one that has had varying views of its entertainment value. And I appreciate everyone’s input. I think the commissioner has a tough job. I think trying to address areas of concern in the game without downplaying the enjoyment or value of the game is very hard. We got corporate sponsors and fans and TV right deals and things like that that would give me the impression that the game is very healthy and very strong. But I understand the need to try to always think differently and try to make sure that you don’t miss out on an opportunity to let the game get better and stronger and more entertaining and more appreciated by its fans. That said, I love the game. Yeah, I see differences in the game all the time, but I think that baseball is trying to address those changes and those differences. I think even this year, we’re seeing that the baseball is not traveling as far. I think that’s reflective somewhat of baseball trying to find a ball that’s made in a way that will have a consistency and not have so much enormous bounce to it or fly to it or win resistance to it, that it’s true for every ballpark and every game. But these kinds of things do challenge the game today. It’s not a secret.*

*But I think that we got to be careful to not talk down on the game when things are different or things are not the way they need to be or should be. But understand that there is a challenge that the game faces with players are adjusting to the game, front offices are adjusting to the game and finding ways to get an edge. And sometimes those with an edge become a challenge to the way we’re used to watching the game be played. So the shift has become a big talking point. It’s a different way of watching the game. I mean, back when Ted Williams played, I mean, Ted Williams was shifted on, but in that day and time, not everybody else was that was left handed. Nowadays, if you’re left handed and you have a slight pull, you’re going to be shifted on, and it’s probably going to affect your batting average by ten or 20 points in a given season.*

(Benny)

*Right.*

(Bobby)

*We just have to be honest with the fact that the game is organic. It is going to need to be dynamically treated. It’s going to have to change. It may not change to everyone’s liking every time it changes, but as long as everybody puts their best efforts together from the commissioner’s office all the way down through the league, we should find ways to get it better and stronger. I understand the three outcomes: a strike out, a walk, or a home run. I get that, too. But I still love watching the game, and I find it exhilarating to see the competition, the level of talent, the quality of the pitching, the approach that hitters are taking that are so different than the approach that was taken five and ten, fifteen years ago. I think it’s dynamic, and for that I love it.*

(Benny)

*Absolutely. I’m really curious to see will we see bigger bases or a 14-second pitch clock, and will they ban the defensive shifts that you’re talking about? So it’s certainly an interesting time to follow along.*

*I’d like to pivot now to kind of back to Chapel Hill. I know you were in the area because you were touring your son or bringing him to UNC. What advice are you giving him in the college process? Or what would you tell us, current scholars, future scholars, about going through the process?*

(Bobby)

*When I think about what you all at Carolina have been through these last couple of years, I’ve got to believe it’s going to create a resilience in you that has a chance to really impact you personally and professionally for the duration of your life and career. It was no easy task for any of us to go through a pandemic, a shutdown of our normal way of life. And the fruit of that for you all will be a resilience and a strength that will be unlike what you might have otherwise. You were asked to endure things that we were never asked to endure as a student. And I think that for that reason, I think you’ll find that you’ll be in a place of strength going forward. No matter what hits you, you’ll know how to battle against it. I think that as you experience your life at Carolina, I think it’s very important to build relationships, build a care for others that maybe unlike even the care that you had for others even in high school, just a greater, deeper care. Get to know people of all ages in and around Chapel Hill. Don’t limit it to just students. Get to know your professors. Get to know the people of Chapel Hill. You’ll work hard and accomplish everything you hope to accomplish academically. But Carolina is more than just the academic environment. There’s also opportunity. There’s opportunity to serve, opportunity to learn and grow in ways inside and outside the classroom that you don’t want to miss. The people that you’re around today will be very different perhaps, than the people that you’ll be around as you enter your career, depending on where you start your career, where you’re located, in a sense, consider yourself planted somewhere for four years and make the most of it. And don’t look at yourself as just there for a short time, because that short time, although it is a short time and it’ll go quickly, there’s a lot that can be accomplished in four years, in your own mind and heart and in your relationship with others.*

(Benny)

*My class in particular, missing the end of senior year and not having that kind of transition period, but I do agree that I think we’ll be used to challenges and hopefully learn as much as we can here and be ready to take it on in the real world. I’d love to do a lightning round. One or two word answers to these quick questions.*

(Bobby)

*You got it.*

(Benny)

*Okay. What’s your go to ballpark meal or snack?*

(Bobby)

*Well, chicken sandwich. And nothing like our ballpark here in San Francisco. But my favorite of all time is Fenway.*

(Benny)

*What do you do to release stress?*

(Bobby)

*I love to spend time with other people to process challenges or issues. That’s a great stress reliever for me. Exercise, playing ball.*

(Benny)

*Who is one of your favorite role models?*

(Bobby)

*One of the people that I really admire is Bob Iger. A lot of what he wrote in his book in terms of leadership, I could really relate to and feel like it really impacted my own leadership. But also, Pat Lincioni is another writer who does a lot of good books on organizational leadership. So those are two leaders that I really admire.*

(Benny)

*Awesome. And last, what’s something you’re most excited for in the future?*

(Bobby)

*I’m excited to see my children grow and develop in their areas of passion, anxious to see how God will shape their hearts and lives in ways that will honor Him and allow them to make an impact wherever they go. So that’s probably the most exciting thing I look forward to.*

(Benny)

*Awesome. Well, thank you so much for your time. It was a real pleasure getting to know you a little bit better, and I really appreciate it.*

(Bobby)

*Hey, Ben, thanks a ton. It was great meeting you and spending time with you. And let’s do it again soon.*

(Benny)

*Yes, sir.*

## Episode Transcription

*Good morning.*

*It is hard to believe that it was 35 years ago that I was a freshman in Chapel Hill. I was the second woman of Indian origin behind Rupal Nayak, who was in the class ahead of me. Yes. Shout out for Rupal. I still think of myself as that wide eyed 18-year-old girl Stephen Aldrich pointed out that might be an example of a beginner mindset. And then I’m reminded that I’m more seasoned than that, being the second speaker in today’s roster rather than the fourth or the fifth.*

*So how many of you have prepared intro slides like this one? So they’ve become a common and very handy and useful tool to tell one story and one’s arc. This is obviously mine. It’s the one I use to introduce myself to my new company earlier this year. The reason I have this up is there is one constant that I will never change. In this slide, this photograph, it is a photo of my extended family celebrating my father’s 80th birthday, which was exactly four years ago yesterday. It tells not only my own journey but also that of my family with which my own story is inextricably intertwined.*

*It also tells the lessons and the values that are central to our journey. The first of these lessons for me is gratitude. I was and am incredibly fortunate to have been born into this family. It is colorful, diverse, loud. Boy, is it loud, resilient, and deeply loyal. It is the kind of family where blood is thicker than water and sticks together through all the trials and tribulations that life throws at you. Through it all, my parents, who are in the center of that picture wearing garlands, have been the matriarch and the patriarch. Not because of birth order, but because of their immense generosity, their deep sense of duty and service, their loyalty, their unabating love and their respect, tolerance, and acceptance of difference. All lessons in leadership without even knowing it. And my dad likes to point out we’re the United Nations. We span four countries, multiple faiths, and including believers and non-believers alike. Although it was just my brother and me, we still managed to have four weddings because we married people of different faiths. But none of this would have been possible without the risks and the leaps of faith that my grandparents took.*

*My father’s parents were from Golden Rock in southern India, a little village. And let me tell you, the only thing golden about Golden Rock was its name. It did have a railway station, and my grandfather had a job at the station and a coveted pension. But my grandmother, who was married to my grandfather at the age of twelve and was wise beyond her limited formal education, knew that my grandfather’s greatest passion was to become a journalist. She also realized that that dream could not occur living in Golden Rock. And they made the decision to take a leap of faith, give up that coveted pension, unexpected at that time and unheard of, and took their gaggle of children for whom they also saw greater opportunity outside of Golden Rock, and moved to Mumbai. While my grandfather never became a journalist, that move and subsequent moves by my parents and their siblings were the sparks that ignited my family. It taught us the importance of following one’s passion, the value of education and being fearless. I’ll admit this last one is more of a work in progress. In two generations, we have doctors, professors, CEOs, communicators, community leaders, teachers, dancers, singers and yes, a lawyer or two.*

*But for all of the love of my family, I would not have shared this photograph as that wide eyed freshman when I arrived at Chapel Hill. And candidly, I would have been embarrassed by it. You see, I grew up in the world desperate to assimilate. It was a schizophrenic existence. On the one hand, within the cocoon of my family and community, I immersed myself in my Indian culture. But outside of it, like the little girl in Tony Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, I wanted to be blonde, blue-eyed, and named Diane or Mary. My own legal name is Hemamalini. Ten letters was too much to hold on to and carry. During my four years at Chapel Hill, I had the space and independence to explore and find my own passions and voice. Faced with a world which was largely black and white. In fact, I remember a panel about white Greeks and black Greeks and asking, “What about the brown Greeks?” I’m not sure I actually ever received an answer or one that was satisfactory. I learned that if I did not embrace my own culture and heritage and my own brownness, then no one would. That lesson of self-acceptance and self-worth is one of the many lessons that I learned in this place that, as Billy Crudup said, “is touched by a strange and special magic.”*

*And I am forever grateful.*

*Thank you and happy Diwali.*

Hailing from a creative household in Burke County, North Carolina, Taylor recounts his upbringing alongside two older brothers, both Carolina alumni, who immersed themselves in music and imaginative projects ([Taylor’s brother, Jacob, is one of the founding members of the string band Mipso](https://www.moreheadcain.org/2022/09/taylor-sharp-16-releases-short-film-about-brother-folk-musician-jacob-sharp-13-of-mipso/)). These early explorations paved the way for his career in filmmaking.

As a Morehead-Cain Scholar, Taylor interned at the Zimbabwean nonprofit [Hoops 4 Hope](https://www.hoops4hope.org/), experiences that informed his 2017 documentary, [Hoops Africa: Ubuntu Matters](https://www.amazon.com/Hoops-Africa-Matters-Hakeem-Olajuwon/dp/B07DKRJ9JR). He also worked at a sports agency with Jim Tanner ’90, president of Tandem Sports + Entertainment, and in New York with Malcolm Turner ’93, then president of what would become the G League.

On today’s episode, Taylor shares other memories from UNC–Chapel Hill, how conversations at He’s Not Here (a famous haunt on Franklin Street in Chapel Hill) led to the founding of Blue Cup Productions, [his work with Shaquille O’Neal and the NBA G League](https://www.bluecupproductions.com/hoop-portraits), and more.

Earlier this year, Taylor and John Zimmerman were inducted into the Southern Fly Fishing Hall of Fame for their humanitarian contributions within the sport. In 2012, they co-founded [Casting for Hope](https://castingforhope.org/), a nonprofit that supports women with ovarian and other gynecological cancers, which has since raised over $1,000,000 for its financial and emotional assistance, programming, and fly-fishing retreats.

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Taylor, thank you so much for speaking with Catalyze tonight.*

(Taylor)

*Oh, it’s so great to be on. Thanks for coming out to Brooklyn.*

(Sarah)

*Yes, we should mention we’re sitting at a café here in your neighborhood, and I wanted to ask when you first moved here and how it’s been for you so far.*

(Taylor)

*So I moved in October of 2021, so I’m coming up on two years. It’s been really wonderful. I’ve had a lot of experience with New York. I spent my third summer, Morehead summer, here working at the NBA. I was living in Spanish Harlem at that time. I have two older brothers, both of whom have spent a lot of time here. My oldest brother has now been here since he graduated from Carolina 14 years ago, and my middle brother, Jacob, was here for like five years before he moved to L.A. So New York has always felt familiar to me, and I’ve come here many times for projects and meetings and seeing my brothers. But I came here this time, moved up with my production partner for no specific reason other than we both were flirting with the idea of moving to L.A. or New York at some point. We really loved our years in Durham and all of my years in North Carolina prior, too, but it just felt like a nice time when we had some new projects coming up in our slate to be surrounded by a new creative community and to have a chapter here. And for me, there’s no defined end to that chapter. I’m here, and it’s really nice to have North Carolina waiting on me should I ever want to go back.*

(Sarah)

*How would you describe the kinds of communities that there are doing similar things like you?*

(Taylor)

*I was fortunate in that I feel like I had a lot of good connections to the music and comedy and film communities, in some ways through my brothers and also through people who I had worked with or had meetings with in the past. So when I came up with my production partner, we were interested in being around that. It’s nice just to be around other people who are performers or pursuing a creative path full time, and so many of our friends here are that way. That’s been really nice just to kind of almost every night there’s someone’s show to go to or some screening of a film, and oftentimes there’s a personal connection there. So that’s just been really wonderful energy to be surrounded by and supported by. But really it was just us, like, wanting a new chapter for ourselves and for the projects we’re working on. And the company, even just in our neighborhood at a café like this, we will sometimes run into a conversation with someone who’s talking about a festival or script they’re working on. And we’ve pretty naturally made some filmmaking buddies just right here in this neighborhood. But, yeah, it just felt like the time to give New York a try.*

(Sarah)

*And you’re the founder of Blue Cup Productions. I was curious if that has any roots to He’s Not Here and their Blue Cups.*

(Taylor)

*Oh, most certainly it does. Yeah. Perfect audience for this backstory. It doesn’t always get told in a meeting with a Netflix or the NBA, like what the story is. Um, so my production partner who I mentioned, Holland Randolph Gallagher, he was my year at UNC. And we knew each other through an entrepreneurship minor class and pickup basketball and having some buddies in kind of a similar creative circle. But we didn’t know each other well. And it was only after school when I had independently put out the first documentary of mine, and he was working on a web series that he had written and was going to direct in Durham when he reached out, was like, “Hey, we’re two people from UNC who knew each other who are now doing film related things. Let’s talk about that.” And we met up at He’s Not Here and a couple of Blue Cups later, we had a lot of similar ideas. And that’s where really, our creative partnership and friendship was really forged. So, yeah, I think it was really just when we made our first short film and we needed to create an LLC for production insurance and renting equipment and the payroll company we were using to pay our crew and stuff that we needed to formalize things.*

*But the notion behind it, I suppose, was something to do with like, there are so many possibilities for collaborators all around you. If you have an idea, there are people around you who might want to embark on that with you. And all it took was a couple of Blue Cups for us to realize that. So we felt paying homage to He’s Not was in a subtle, maybe not so subtle way for a UNC person, felt fitting.*

(Sarah)

*And I think that kind of goes into your whole style, which is on intimate documentaries and narrative storytelling. And so it feels like you’re up close and getting the humanity of the conversation. If you could clone yourself or just to, say, have infinite time and resources, what are a few projects that you would love to take on right now?*

(Taylor)

*Oh, gosh, that’s a good one. I think I wouldn’t take on any more as much as I would just be able to devote more of myself to finish the ones we’re currently working on. And some of those just take time because the stories are still unfolding or the emotional or the creative fabric is still being sewn somehow to where even if I had more time, I don’t know if it would service it to finish it right away. So I think there’s a healthy amount of patience that has gone into them because it serves the project. But we’ve been working on a few, one in basketball, one in rap, and one a very personal story about grief related to my mom and my family that incorporates my brothers. Those are three independent projects that we’ve just worked on as our company and for the past few years, and we’ll probably wrap up in the next year. I think this summer is an opportunity to sink our teeth back into those a little bit because this past fall to spring and upcoming in this next fall to spring, we have a lot of projects ongoing with the NBA G League.*

(Taylor)

*So I kind of view this summer as a time to recalibrate and focus on some of those personal projects as we prepare for the slate of documentaries that we’ll be doing for the NBA in this upcoming season. So that’s kind of our balance is navigating the projects that we have put on our plate personally versus the ones that we’ve taken on in partnership with other people. And naturally, the latter requires a certain timeline and the former is more on our terms.*

(Sarah)

*And how did the partnership come about with the NBA G League? And is it true that you have Shaquille O’Neill’s phone number?*

(Taylor)

*Yes, yes. I’ll answer the second one first. I can’t say that I’m utilizing that phone number every day. I’m going to wait for the right moment there. But yeah, we were able to work with Shaquille as the narrator for the documentary series we did with the G League this season and that we’ll be doing another season of next year. And he was really wonderful to work with, really validated us, and was kind and fun to work with. It was always exciting working with him, but he’s a true professional that made us—I think there’s a lot of pressure to work with someone that high caliber and well known as Shaq—and from the very beginning, he was really respectful to us and gave us his best and was also fun to work with and friendly in such a way that now it feels like we just have a friend who we’re collaborating with with the G League. Yeah, that’s a great, Morehead-Cain story. I can’t say that we would be doing any of that if it weren’t for my connection to the Foundation and my summers as a scholar. I spent all three of my summers during college in different sides of the basketball world, and particularly the last two had very specific alumni influences because I had worked for Jim Tanner at Tandem, in the sports agency capacity my sophomore summer, and then junior summer, I worked for Malcolm Turner when he had come on as president of the NBA Developmental League, which is now the G League. So I have been involved with the G League since that summer of 2015 when I was here the first time. And looking around the G League, there aren’t all that many people who have been around for those eight years. There are some people I’ve known who have worked full time for the G League since then, who have really been long stays there. But so many of the people who are there now that I’m working with are talking to me and asking me questions about when I was first there with Malcolm. So there’s a huge credit to Malcolm for hiring me as a project employee while I was still in school to work with him for the summer. And even in my senior year, he hired me back to work at All-Star and to work other events. So my journey at the NBA got started because of Malcolm and because of the Morehead-Cain.*

(Sarah)

*And can you share about the documentary that involved following three players who had very different prospects and stories and backgrounds, and how you selected them, and just what it was like to follow along journeys that you didn’t know how they would end?*

(Taylor)

*Yeah. So the project we did with the NBA G League over the course of this past basketball season followed three of the marquee players of the G League, which is the minor league of the NBA, and we wanted to have three diverse stories that would ultimately showcase what the league is as a whole, who are the types of people who make up G League players. So we chose a veteran, someone who had been in the NBA but then had fallen out of the NBA, was trying to make their way back. And we chose Norris Cole. He played with LeBron on the Heat in his first two years, won an NBA Championship. So he’s been to the mountaintop there, and he’s trying to get back. And then we also chose a player who has the opportunity of getting called up from the G League to the NBA. So every night he’s playing for that opportunity to make his dream come true, right. And to get to the NBA, to have an NBA contract. So we chose Mac McClung, who was a fan favorite, was Rookie of the Year in his last season. And we knew that he had an opportunity to make an NBA roster by the end of the season. So we just loved the idea of potentially being able to capture that. And then the other one, which is really indicative of the uniqueness of the G League, is that we chose a draft-eligible prospect, a young player who’s going to be a future NBA star. But for right now, he’s the youngest American to sign a professional contract in the US, 17, bypassing his last year of high school and college to go become a professional with the G League. His name is Scoot Henderson from Atlanta. So we chose these three players because Scoot’s going to be a top draft pick next month, and he’ll be a franchise player for many years to come. But his time is tomorrow. But Mac is shooting for his time today, and Norris has kind of already had his moment, and he just wants to scratch that again. So those three players in some ways represent the G League, and we thought embedding ourselves in their storylines for a season would give a really good inside look at what the G League is all about.*

(Sarah)

*How are you thinking about this upcoming cycle? And maybe not how you do it differently, but just what goes into the strategy and those conversations with your business partner about how to approach it?*

(Taylor)

*It was a really new thing for the G League to do this, and wonderful for us to take on that type of partnership because it was a high visibility, high responsibility project, and we were leading the way on capturing and editing all of this, maintaining the relationships with those players. And it was a big part of a massive partnership that they had brought on with the General Insurance, who is sponsoring this. So for us, we really just wanted to deliver a docuseries that was going to be entertaining for viewers and that the players who are participating would be proud of and feel properly represented by. But also we were thinking like, we got hired to do this, we need this to serve the NBA G League’s expectations as well, and hope that the General Insurance was going to be happy about it since they were paying for it. Now that we’re through season one, everyone’s very happy. We got gifted with some amazing stories. We learned a lot through making it. It was a success by the opinion of everyone involved, and we’re coming on for season two. So now it’s just a matter of replicating that, hoping that we have as amazing of stories on court and off as we were fortunate to have this year.*

(Taylor)

*And I think for us now, we have a level of confidence of, all right, we were navigating through some murky waters of how to do this in season one, but now we’re confident in being able to do that. And I think that will allow us the creative flexibility to push ourselves even further, to try some things that we didn’t last year. So we’re excited, not only to replicate, but hopefully to make it even more compelling storytelling in season two.*

(Sarah)

*It seems very innovative of the G League to even think about narrative storytelling and doing this kind of content. And so I’m wondering if other similar types of leagues will do that as well, which might be a complement to the sort of playbook that you’re demonstrating to them.*

(Taylor)

*Yeah, I hope so. I’m really happy that they were willing to see the value in documenting the story of the players in their league. They are creating a time capsule for themselves as a league and all of the amazing stories that are contained within it. The G League has grown so much like flipping it back to Malcolm Turner. There were, I think, 12 or 13 teams in the G League when he was hired in 2015, now there are 30. And that was a big credit to his growth strategy for how this league could become a much bigger thing than it was. And I think there are just such amazing stories that have happened in the time that he was hired since I’ve been involved now. And it’s important to document those because when we flash forward a little bit, some of these players who we’re documenting now are big NBA stars. It’s important for the G League to be able to have those moments when they were G Leaguers captured. So, for me, as someone who’s been involved in the G League for a while, there’s a lot of pride in showcasing the special stuff that’s happening there. And I think on their end, it’s really important for them to just to be able to kind of show what they’ve been doing this whole time.*

(Sarah)

*Going back to having your hand in many different areas of the basketball world, do you feel like those experiences, even though you ultimately didn’t decide to become a sports agent, that that’s helped in a way because you’re still in the business from the stories angle, but I’m sure you’re seeing a lot of familiar things that you were exposed to in college and afterwards?*

(Taylor)

*It’s amazing the ways that all of those experiences and communities and connections and worlds have continued to coalesce in some way. I work with agents all the time in that when I am doing something with the G League or I’m doing something independently, whatever it may be, when we’re working with a player, oftentimes I’m communicating with the agent at some point. And it’s nice for me to have that perspective of what that relationship is like. It’s nice that I have some level of fluency in what a player experience is like, what someone out of league’s experience is like, what an agent’s experience is like. So that when I’m partnering with these people on telling someone’s story, I can make it as easy as possible for them to understand what they need to so that we can all really feel like we’re collaborating together and deciding what access that I then get to be able to capture someone’s story. So, yeah, it’s been really helpful, I think, for me in that I think whenever you’re familiar with the territory you’re navigating, it’s just a little bit easier to move forward. So I think, as opposed to me being an outsider to the basketball world, having had a lot of experience in different areas of the basketball world before even becoming a filmmaker, it’s really helped on the filmmaking side of things because I think they trust me to understand the nuances of everything, and that’s been really beneficial.*

(Sarah)

*And was it going back to Africa to do the documentary there that was the turning point to decide, I want to do film, and maybe that’s in basketball or maybe it’s elsewhere, or when did that, I guess, turning point happen for you?*

(Taylor)

*Good question. Yeah. At that time, it really goes back to my public service summer, which was the summer of 2013 after my first year. And I felt like I had this unique opportunity to spin a globe and put a blindfold on and put my finger on it and make it stop and see where I wanted to go. Because there are plenty of NGOs where I could have gone and a lot of interests that I had and past scholars’ experiences that I was reading their reports from, trying to decide where I was going to go. And I actually was taking a break from the research, and I was reading an ESPN article about the Boston Celtics and their relationship with this Zimbabwean nonprofit and this African philosophy of ubuntu. And that’s how I learned about Hoops for Hope, the nonprofit that ultimately I spent that summer with. I called the founder on that day and told him about my opportunity to volunteer with an organization, and I told him about the Morehead-Cain, and they were receptive to me coming. And fortunately, the Foundation allowed me to do so. And it was my summer there that ultimately would push me into filmmaking, because as a result of that summer, I fell in love with what Hoops for Hope did.*

*I had a host little brother who had a dream of making it to the US through basketball, and I left that experience really wanting to shine a light on all of that. So my first film was because of my love for Hoops for Hope and the work they do, and because of that desire to shine a light on Watida’s story. I wouldn’t have otherwise found my way into film if it weren’t for that formidable experience. And I think it’s the summers that came after it that enabled that project to actually come together in a serious way.*

(Sarah)

*And you also were part of the script writing process for an evacuation love story that was played at the Varsity Theater and have since also done a documentary, a short film on your brother through the Visit North Carolina series, which you won as well. So congratulations for that recognition. How do you decide that this is something that you want to invest in as a project?*

(Taylor)

*I’ve always been guided just by what stories were really gnawing at me in a way of like, I don’t think we’ve ever really worked on a project where it wasn’t, the feeling of this story has to be told. And no matter how, we will tell it, even if it can’t find funding, we’ll do it independently or go out and find the right partner for it. So those in particular, the first one that Camilla, Keep Your Word, the first narrative film I’d worked on, a short film that I worked on with Holland, was a personal experience for him as someone whose family evacuated Hurricane Katrina. That’s how he made his way to North Carolina. So that was my first way getting into, my first time getting into scripted work. And we’re doing a lot of development on that side now. So I’m really fortunate that Holland came into my world because it broadened my horizons beyond documentary work and into the idea of working on scripted stuff. And I think there’s a very full chapter of that to come for us. And then, yeah, the short film that we did on my brother, Jacob, was really fun because that’s a story I know so well and a story that I have so much care for and a heart for and fortunately Visit North Carolina, North Carolina Tourism, commissioned some filmmakers to do short films set in North Carolina. So they came to me, and I got to pitch them on doing a film about my brother. And fortunately, they funded it. And fortunately, with the help of so many in the Carolina community, we were able to win that contest. So yeah, every project feels somehow very different, yet ultimately connected, because so many of them are projects that we’re pretty passionate about, and it feels a lot less like work and a lot more just like needing to tell the story.*

(Sarah)

*And we are on a podcast, so we need to mention your childhood at least once. But I’m curious where you get your knack for identifying stories. Is that something that was a big part of your family or just something innate in you? Because it’s not natural for everyone to see things that need to be told.*

(Taylor)

*I am the youngest brother of three, three brothers who all went to Carolina. Go Heels! I’d like to say that I was actually the biggest Carolina fan of the three. And in fact, the older two were looking into other schools and the younger brother, who was just obsessed with Carolina was like, well, if you want me to visit you, it should be Chapel Hill. And thank God the two of them went because I was really young. My middle school and high school years were visiting my brothers. So I felt like my Carolina experience started much earlier than most people’s Carolina experience did. But growing up in our house, it was always a creative home. We were taking piano lessons and my brothers especially were really into music from an early age. My oldest brother and I would make home videos replicating James Bond and Indiana Jones movies. So always we were, the three of us, playing. And oftentimes that was musical or somehow storytelling related. Sports took on a big part of my life as I got older. But, yeah, growing up, we did have a lot of creativity in the house, and I think that’s a testament to our parents for allowing for that imagination.*

*And then after Carolina, when we decided to pursue these creative paths professionally, them not recommending we not. I think there are a lot of parents who would suggest, maybe you shouldn’t be a comedian or a musician or a documentary filmmaker. These paths aren’t exactly, they don’t exactly guarantee a great income. And fortunately, we had wonderfully supportive parents who wanted nothing more than for us to pursue what we felt was truest to us. And that allowed our passions to kind of rise to the top in how we spent our time, and that manifested us all having creative careers. Now, I guess if you can say the word career at the end of that. So, yeah, both my brothers and myself, I think, are really fortunate for that upbringing.*

(Sarah)

*Do you have any guiding questions that you have turned to in trying to make a decision about what to do of, is this a place I want to live, or is this an issue I really care about? What goes on in your mind when you’re making those kinds of calculated decisions, when it might not be just about money, is what I’m hearing.*

(Taylor)

*It’s been a challenge for me at times to know where to put my energy because I’ve had so many different projects, some that we haven’t even spoken about that I would never want to give up. So when deciding on the next thing, I always have to consider all the other things that I’m already doing. But I think it’s also been helpful because it’s really made me be incredibly intentional about what I decide to do because there are already a lot of important things in play. There are already a lot of balls that I’m juggling that I would not want to drop or put down. And I think that’s been a helpful guiding force because it’s really forced me to not take on a project unless it had a really good reason for being there. The give and the take there, I suppose I feel like I haven’t even since high school, had a blank slate to decide what will I put there, but rather, it’s been I’ve had this wonderful tapestry of these things I care about that I think have given me a barometer for deciding what would enter that equation. So generally, when I embark on a new project or a new idea, there’s a really good reason that it’s there. So I just trust my intuition in that way and try the things that feel important to try and see where they lead.*

(Sarah)

*So I wanted to ask any final advice you might have for scholars who are interested in getting into film or about changing from, you’re doing the basketball thing, might be a sports agent, but deciding to follow this other concurrent interest in film, I think?*

(Taylor)

*I think it’s just to give yourself the opportunity to pursue these new fascinations that you have. For me, my experience as a scholar really validated my multidisciplinary approach to things. I think my entire college career was very interdisciplinary, but that was aided in a serious way by the variety of experiences that I was supported to do by the Foundation. And I don’t think that that necessarily has to stop as you leave Carolina. I think the idea that you can always be evolving and that you can be mindful of that and that you can surround yourself with the things that most make sense with that evolution is totally okay, and the perfect time to do that is when you’re a college student, but a pretty great time to do it is in the years after, as well. So that would maybe be some of my advice, is just allow yourself that opportunity to check in with yourself and pursue the next idea, if that’s the most important idea to you now.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you. And thank you as well for all of the calls you’ve taken from current scholars who are trying to explore these very questions of what they want to get into, as well as being a class ambassador and helping us out for Day of Giving and rallying up your classmates. Why do you get involved in those ways? And what might you say to another classmate who would be interested in getting engaged in some way with the Foundation?*

(Taylor)

*I’m always happy to chat with someone who’s a part of the network. I mean, I feel like, and more broadly, anyone who’s interested in film or basketball or nonprofit work, whatever it may be. I feel like so many things in my own projects were made possible by something I learned from someone else or some connection that someone else made for me. So I feel indebted in many ways to the people who answered my emails or were willing to get on a call with me or take a coffee meeting. And so anytime that anyone else wants to do that with me, who am I to say no? So I’m really appreciative of the interest that any scholar has in talking to me and very willing to do so and am hopeful that they are willing to look around the network that they’re a part of and be willing to intentionally reach out to those who are especially fitting for them to do so, and that later on in life, they’ll do the same because it’s a special treat, I feel like, to be able to remain connected to a community that was really beneficial in creating the world that I kind of have around me now.*

(Sarah)

*We really appreciate it. Is there anything else you would like to share about what people can expect to see from Taylor Sharp or Blue Cup Productions in the coming months? Or anything else you’d like to share about your projects?*

(Taylor)

*Well, I’ll say I’ll thank anyone who was voting for that film contest you mentioned earlier, because I would certainly need to apologize if we didn’t win after all your efforts. And it’s a fun thing that I don’t even know the projects that I’ll be wanting to point people towards a year from now. There are a lot of things that are in the works that will come out when there ready. And for now, I’m just appreciative of all the support that the UNC and Morehead-Cain community has given me. So thanks for listening.*

(Sarah)

*Taylor, thank you so much.*

(Taylor)

*Thank you.*

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Well, Sam, Scott, Jonny, and Nicholas, thank you so much for joining Catalyze.*

(All)

*Thanks so much for having us.*

(Scott)

*Thank you for having us.*

(Sarah)

*So recycleReality. I’m not surprised that you all got together and did something really cool, but I would love to hear more about the company and just where it started. The last time we talked, Sam and Nicholas, y’all were in Georgia in Smithonia doing creative projects there back in the pandemic.*

(Nicholas)

*It goes much further back than.*

(Scott)

*We don’t really have a clean start, I guess. It really emerged out of kind of a network of creative collaborations that, I mean, I don’t know when you two started making music and stuff together, but yeah.*

(Sam)

*Like junior year, I think Nicholas’s senior year, was when we really were digging into things.*

(Scott)

*Yeah, so Nicholas and I met in 2018. We both spent that summer, our Morehead internships were in Los Angeles, and we lived in a house together. And that was kind of when we started doing freelance creative work together in media and entertainment through Nicholas’s internship at Red Bull. We both worked as production assistants at Lollapalooza, a big music festival, that summer. And that was like a foray into some of this for me, at least. Our senior year, 2018 to 2019, or my senior year, was when we got into Office Hours, which was kind of Nicholas’s big guest thesis project is the best way to put it. It was like an independent study you were doing at UNC. And that was a big, at that point, I’d been really focused on The Meantime \[Coffee Co.\] for my first three years, and then I was on the board at that point, I think, and had freed up a bunch of extracurricular time and kind of dove into this with Nicholas. And Sam was also there and played a part in that, as well, in terms of our early thinking about the video synthesizers and TVs and everything that we were getting into.*

Scott is the co-founder and former CEO of The Meantime Coffee Co., located in the UNC Campus Y.

*But yeah, then I think the summer, fast forward, like summer 2020 when Sam—and into fall of 2020—Sam and Nicholas were living in Georgia. I was there for maybe a month chunk in the middle, but we were all kind of doing other stuff primarily, but had been doing creative work together in this sphere. And we had someone reach out asking for a website for this band called Baby Boys, and it was a Durham-based artist management company called The Glow that manages Sylvan Esso and a bunch of other amazing artists in the indie genre primarily. But they reached out and saw some of the work that we had been doing just independently as kind of an artistic practice and asked us to do like a visual campaign and website for this artist. And it sounded super cool to us. Obviously it wasn’t really like, yeah, it emerged spontaneously from that. We did that project, we worked on this ipod emulator website that was a labor of love. And it was like, really fun working. I don’t know, this is kind of getting . . .*

(Sam)

*Yeah, that was definitely main spark, I would say, was that project. It was the first thing that brought all three of us together. And I think we really just enjoyed collaborating in that environment because our skill sets mesh so well together. We filled in each other’s sort of skill gaps really well. The way that I pitch it these days is that Nicholas is really good at making things that are pretty, I’m really good at making things that work, and Scott is really good at making things that are pretty, work, or make things that work prettier. And so the three of us together, coming together on that project, was just a really exciting experience for all three of us, I think, and really laid a solid foundation of wanting to continue to collaborate on these types of projects, see where the word of mouth of that first project could lead. And it’s led all the way here to all three of us being in person together in New York now for the first time.*

(Sarah)

*So it sounds like there was this idea that you would work really well together someday, but maybe needed this catalyst of the assignment to really see how your different skills could complement each other. And I’d love to hear more about the background. And I love the quick pitch that you gave about the aesthetics versus more machine learning, which, Sam, I know that’s more your specialty. And also catch us up of where you were right before deciding to launch this. What were you doing?*

(Sam)

*It was a very confusing and interesting time, at least I’d say for myself. I’m sure we all felt that to varying degrees. For me in particular, graduating right at the start of the first peak of the pandemic, right. Came back from spring break in my senior year and sort of everything had changed. And then there was this sort of big open question mark as to what to do next. And that’s what led us all to Georgia. But we were all enjoying our time there, but taking very seriously planning for the future and what the next steps from there would be. So I wound up starting a graduate program, getting my Master’s in Computer Science at Stanford while I was still at The Farm online, and then wound up out on the West Coast for a couple of years finishing that up. And Nicholas was starting to look into graduate programs as well and wound up at Parsons in New York doing lighting design, which he just finished his MFA in.*

(Sarah)

*Congratulations.*

(Nicholas)

*Thanks.*

(Sam)

*Yeah, just a couple of months ago. So that was sort of the last hurdle for us to clear, for us all to have free calendars and the free time to be able to really dive in deep on recycleReality and see what we can turn this into.*

(Nicholas)

*I think also what has kind of characterized our work together from the start, and our client work in general, is that we do a lot of learning on the job, where it’s like, okay, maybe we haven’t done this exact type of project before, but it sits somewhere in the middle of our skill sets, and it’s something that we want to learn to do. And so I think working together while we’ve been in school over the past couple of years also kind of made learning part of the ethos of what we do. And so I think that we are still figuring out what we’re going to do next and are trying new projects and landing new client gigs and that kind of thing. So it’s been great, and it’s really wonderful to be together in person for the first time because we’ve been working together for years, but now it’s like we are able to focus in a different way, and it feels like we have kind of a fresh start, even though we’ve been working together for a while.*

(Sarah)

*And you also have Jonny with you. I’d love to hear how you heard about this and what you’ve been working on with recycleReality this summer?*

(Jonny)

*So that’s a funny story. I actually remember coming into Carolina freshman year and [reading about their U-Haul journey on the Morehead website](https://www.moreheadcain.org/2020/10/the-catalyze-podcast-eric-lee-18-nicholas-byrne-19-and-sam-lowe-20-on-making-music-art-on-the-road-with-u-haul/), and that was my first introduction to them. Obviously, they all graduated before I first got there in 2020. But yeah, I was just looking for internships for this summer. I knew I wanted to do something more tech-driven, maybe like software engineering, web development, something in those areas. So I did what a lot of people do, and I turned to the Morehead-Cain Network and scrolled through the current job postings, and I found recycleReality’s posting, and yeah, it brought me back to seeing them freshman year, and I’m like, whoa, now they started a business together, and they’re wanting an intern. And I kind of saw the job description was looking for someone who had experience in tech, like computer science, majoring in computer science, and it seemed really interesting. I checked out their website and a lot of their projects that they have in their blog, and I was just really intrigued. So I applied, and we had a couple of interviews, really not even interviews, just like we were just talking on the phone, getting to know each other and see if it was a good fit. And yeah, now that I’m here, I can gladly say that it’s been an amazing summer, and it’s been a really good time. Really good fit.*

Jonny Huang ’24

(Sarah)

*That’s great. I love that you came across their first Catalyze podcast that turned into an internship so many years later. So that’s great to hear that. recycleReality is a little hard to understand for someone who might not be used to the creative technology space. It sounds really neat, the kinds of experiences that you create for different clients, but maybe a way of getting at the kind of expertise you all bring, can you share about some current projects as well as maybe some of the ad campaigns that were recognized by Amazon music and Overall Murals?*

(Sam)

*So really exciting. The past few months, I’ve been working pretty much full time on an experience, the first version of which released just a couple of weeks ago. It’s for a new sort of spinoff label of the Glow management called Psychic Hotline. And one of their big first releases is a collaborative audiovisual album. There are a sequence of tracks named after the letters of the alphabet in pairs, so there’s 13 tracks A B through Y Z, and there is artwork that goes with each of the tracks. And we’ve been working on an in-browser, but also VR experience for that to build sort of a virtual gallery that people can go through and explore the art and the music in tandem, and really try and take advantage of those mediums to present the art in ways that you can’t do elsewhere. Because they already have plans for a physical album release that’s on vinyl and comes with a printed copy of all the art and things like that. So we were trying to really take that core concept and stretch it as far as possible. So in the version that just released, it’s for the first single CD, you find yourself in a hallway and at either end there’s a painting. And I was sort of inspired by the old video game, the Super Mario game for the Nintendo 64, where you go through all these different paintings and you wind up in different worlds that are the actual levels of the game. So when you get close to the painting, the sort of world around you fades away and you find yourself in sort of a black void with paintings on either side, and things start to grow out from behind the paintings on the walls. Floating pieces of the paintings start flying through the sky in front of you and really sort of try and elevate the fundamental pieces of visual art and audio that we were given from the artist team to try and expand that in new directions. So the VR project sort of has its roots in a lot of the graduate work that I was doing at Stanford. So I was in the CS department, but I spent a lot of time at The Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. Funnily enough, my first experience with that center, which is called Carma for short, was a Discovery Fund project my freshman year. I did a couple of workshops out there over the summer, and I was really inspired by the way that they sort of combined computers and technology with music and took a lot of classes there while I was a student and did some VR research at the time as well. And so that sort of led directly into giving me sort of the foundation to do this new project.*

(Sarah)

*It sounds so immersive and really neat that you can pull in things that you might not think would work well together, but create really cool visuals. And Nicholas, I would love to hear if your music has played a part or if it’s more about the lighting design that you’ve been working on up in New York City.*

(Nicholas)

*I mean, music is in common on all of our projects, essentially, or most of our projects. A lot of them are making visuals for album releases in some way, maybe it’s video content, advertising content, websites, or VR experiences now. I think that music is a huge part of my life and influences how I do work making. My graduate thesis was about pairing visual information and music and how our brain understands those things and how can you use both of those components to make an experience interesting. So, yeah, I’ve been doing also some lighting design in New York, doing lights at venues for different artists and also designing a light fixture, so you can see this thing actually in the top right corner of the screen, the black box, the light box that I designed. And we can send you some photos of what it looks like when it’s lit up, but it responds to musical inputs. I use light and color to inspire my music making process, and I think that you can use music to inspire your visual process as well. So, yeah, it’s interesting. We’re currently looking into getting this so this is a prototype of this light box, but we’re looking into getting it fabricated somewhere in New York and trying to sell a kind of art piece currently, and developing a software that could control the lights, as well, and integrate with music is a goal of ours in the future. And we’re also working on building a smaller miniature version of it that we can 3D print in our studio ourselves. And so that’s something that Jonny’s also been working on this summer, learning how to program some LEDs with Raspberry Pis. So he had some experience with that before he came this summer, building an electronic skateboard. So that’s been a good project that’s been an overlap between my thesis work and also some of Jonny’s interests as well.*

(Sarah)

*Very cool. And you all focus on music, fashion, art, and architecture. How did you decide on those four to zero in on? And Nicholas, you’re speaking to how music is often intersecting with all of these projects, and so that’s a natural one, but I also thought it was interesting how you’re going into these different industries which have their own different micro trends or different needs.*

(Scott)

*As a studio or an agency starting out, we have been in the mindset of saying yes to everything. And so it was kind of a strategic lack of focus in the beginning. As a result, maybe some of the language on our website or looking at all of our projects, it’s like, huh, this is interesting, but this seems like they’ve cast a really wide net in terms of what they’re doing. And I mean, from a practical standpoint, you say yes to clients that come to you and are willing to pay for something. And then on the other side of it, we’re new to this. None of us come from, we have kind of eclectic backgrounds, but what we don’t have is like a traditional agency background here in New York City. And so a lot of this has been self taught and figuring it out as we go, and we figure out what we like and don’t like and learn by doing, as Nicholas said. So I think that category of music, fashion, art, and architecture probably was like, a client came to us in one of those lanes, we enjoyed it, we maybe found a couple more things in that lane, and it felt like an umbrella that made sense. And we had enough feedback from enough mentors who were like, you need to create an umbrella like that so people know when they go to your site and when they look at your portfolio, like, what category of work—we’ve done projects that aren’t on our site and aren’t in that category, but the work that we showcase and what we talk about, we try to keep it focused because that’s kind of the direction we want to move in. Partly also just a result of living in New York City, it’s like a huge cultural hub, obviously, and all of those industries are super vibrant here. So it’s just like, we’re choosing to be here. It makes sense to work in those areas. Another project plug that I will give because you were asking there, and it’s going live right after this interview, is we just made a website for VFILES, which is an arts and fashion nonprofit here in New York City. So by the time, I don’t know when this is going to be shared, but it’ll be [live@vfiles.org](mailto:live@vfiles.org) whenever this is live. And that has been a really fun project to work on for me over the past couple of months, helping them with some of their communication strategy and then just traditional web design and development.*

*So what Sam talked about, the Audiobook 3D VR is more out there in terms of creative technology and pushing the limits of it. We also just make your standard website and make it work and make it look good. And that’s kind of the bread and butter of those web tech services. And so, yeah, this has been a really fun project. I was working in communication strategy at a nonprofit before recycleReality, and then The Meantime, obviously was a nonprofit as well. And I’ve really enjoyed doing communications, marketing, just generally working in that social sphere. And it was a really cool opportunity to get to work for VFILES, which covers arts and fashion, but through that social impact lens, and I’m definitely excited about trying to bring more of that into our portfolio and work as well.*

(Sarah)

*I’ve also appreciated the kind of through line about learning as you go a bit because you all are doing new things in an industry that’s changing so quickly, using technology that’s rapidly advancing. And so it seems like you all have the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that isn’t daunted by, oh gosh, this new thing has come out, but moreso how do we figure out how to use it well? What does it look like when you get a client or are approached with a problem, just what that first meeting looks like?*

(Nicholas)

*I think it depends on the project and the people that are coming to us and our current relationship to them. I think a lot of times just like meeting with someone in person and fleshing out the idea is really wonderful if there’s already an existing relationship, and some of our relationships are more casual like that where you’re kind of spitballing and brainstorming either in person or over text or something as simple as that. But if it’s maybe a client that’s a little bit newer to us or is part of a larger organization that is very official, we then start to act official, and we make pitch decks and communicate differently. So we kind of meet the projects where they are and kind of shapeshift in that way depending on how it seems like the relationship will best be served. So that’s kind of a fun part of this whole thing, too, is we each kind of have our own client relationships that started by knowing us individually or somehow, and so we kind of manage them in different ways. So that’s a fun aspect of it. And a lot of our work is communicating to people about the work that we’re going to do or the work that we want to do. You’d like to be doing design work all day, but at least we’re talking to interesting people about an interesting subject. Most of the time.*

(Sam)

*It’s definitely a spectrum, and I think a big part of the work for us is with repeat clients, like we’ve worked with The Glow in a lot of different formats through the different projects we’ve done.*

(Scott)

*They are the ones who kicked us off back at the beginning with that Baby Boys project. Shout out to The Glow.*

(Sam)

*But it’s really been about building a sort of sense of trust with them, and that I think at this point they’re pretty confident in the work that we do and know that we have sort of a high bar for ourselves and would never turn in something that we didn’t personally believe in or were really excited about. So when this audiobook project came around, they just thought it would be interesting to have a VR experience to go along with it, but they didn’t really know what the possibilities there were and sort of kicked the ball pretty firmly in our court at that point to dream up what we could within our understanding of the technical confines and then sort of pursue that project from that point. So yeah, it really is over a spectrum and very constantly evolving.*

(Sarah)

*Let’s say a year from now, where do each of you hope to be or what’s a mountain you hope to have climbed by then?*

(Nicholas)

*We just got this shelf yesterday.*

(Sarah)

*What does the shelf do?*

(Nicholas)

*Well, so now we’re starting our library, and I think that we’re kind of starting to do all the things that we wanted to always do, literally starting yesterday with this shelf in some sense is starting to have all of our equipment set up so that we can use it at any point in time. And feeling like we have a really functioning studio, I think, is a great goal for the next year for us as far as the work we’re able to produce on a regular basis. I would love to have these light boxes in people’s homes who I don’t know even in a year’s time, that would be really cool, and we’re working towards that. But yeah, we’re also just like taking baby steps and getting comfortable where we are and kind of settling into running this business.*

(Scott)

*This light box is kind of the first prototype and is one of many kind of internal product and, whether physical or software product ideas that we have as a team, we’re trying to balance that interest research prototyping with the more agency side client work that is kind of like what pays the bills currently. And so we’ve been trying to find that balance, and that’s over the next six months and year, I think, this is going to be when we figure out how to make that work or don’t and pick one. But I think a year from now, I would like to be solid on, hopefully have the light box and some products, whatever form that takes, have our work out in the world in that way and also just continue building and have that really solid list of clients that we trust and enjoy working with and keep building beautiful work there.*

(Sarah)

*Jonny, I’m curious for you going back to campus, what you’re hoping to get out of this next year?*

(Jonny)

*Ooh, that’s a good question. I think my priority is to just enjoy the time with people I love. But also, I think coming back from this summer, it’s really given me a really good glimpse into what life after college could be like. It’s been really cool seeing how three friends out of college can come together and really make something really cool. So yeah, I don’t know, I think going into senior year, definitely going to be keeping up with recycleReality. I’m really excited to see how the light box evolves. Yeah, I’m just going to take every moment as it is and really spend time with the people that I probably won’t have that much time, won’t be able to see, I won’t be able to go to Meantime and grab a coffee with anymore. I won’t be able to get dinner at the dining hall with them. I think, yeah, senior year is going to be super fun, but going to be hard to let go.*

(Sam)

*Who knows, you might start a business with them.*

(Jonny)

*Yeah, that’s the idea.*

(Nicholas)

*Figure out how you don’t have to have a boss, you know? You become your boss though.*

(Scott)

*I was just going to say quick shout out to Jonny. He’s been just the best intern and team member that we could imagine this summer. That’s been a really useful exercise for us, too. We work with a big network of collaborators, but it’s been us three as the core team for a while now, and so it was like a really helpful exercise to add Jonny to the mix. And, yeah, he just fit right in and worked on some great stuff together and was here for such a pivotal point of us moving into this studio and getting our shelf yesterday, as Nicholas said. So yeah. Thank you, Jonny. Yeah, it’s been awesome.*

(Jonny)

*It’s been awesome, and I think the biggest thing I’ll take from this summer is just that “yes” mentality and always willing to try new things and be open minded. One of my favorite stories from the summer, experiences in the summer, has been going over to New York to set up a lighting design rigging for an event there, and that was something that I never thought that I’d be doing and something that I never expected to do during this internship. But it ended up being one of the coolest experiences of my time here, and I learned a lot about lighting design from Nicholas, learned how to drive a scissor lift, met a lot of really cool people, especially like Nicholas’s friends from Parsons. That’s probably the biggest takeaway from this summer is just to be open. You never know what an opportunity might give you.*

(Sarah)

*Great perspective going into senior year, for sure. Is there anything you’d want to share to all of you for the Morehead-Cain alumni community because this podcast is for primarily Morehead-Cains and so any ways that you might want to collaborate with alumni or be supported in any way?*

(Sam)

*We do embrace that “yes” mentality in our work and are always excited to sort of broaden our horizons in the kind of things that we do. And our email inbox is always open. If you have an off the wall idea for a cool media project, and you need a crack team of engineers to hop on it, that we would be more than happy to connect, or even just connect to talk about this sort of shared world that we find ourselves in more broadly. So we definitely would love to get that message out there.*

(Sarah)

*So if anyone needs some bespoke design or software solutions to reach out to you all. Is there anything I didn’t ask you that you’d want to share?*

(Sam)

*One thing that I missed my opportunity to touch on earlier in talking about embracing the learning process in our work and always reevaluating the tool set that we use to approach a project. I know you mentioned the Amazon mural project in one of the questions, and I think that’s a really good example because the backdrop for that mural that we designed for this project with Amazon Music and Breland, the artist who was being highlighted in that project, was to generate a backdrop with what at the time were the latest AI models for visual generations, which were generative adversarial networks. And so we had to train our own model that we had gotten off the shelf that could produce impressionist landscapes, and I retrained it solely on city skyscrapers. And it got caught in this sort of weird middle zone between those two things and gave us this sort of really surreal landscape pictures that we could stitch together into the mural. And then here we are now, not even two years out from that project, and that approach is completely outmoded by things like stable diffusion.*

*So I think AI is a really good example of the types of technologies that we lean on that are changing very rapidly, but that we’re always excited to embrace the newest thing and find out ways to use it and also break it in interesting ways.*

(Scott)

*I like that. Closing with the most technical for the nerds. That was a great point for the nerds. Yeah, absolutely.*

(Nicholas)

*Yeah, I also just wanted to say a continued thank you from us four to the Morehead-Cain. Johnny here this summer, you know, you supported him, but you’re also supporting us in that way and also speaking with us today. We really appreciate it and are excited to continue to be part of this network of people.*

(Scott)

*Yeah, obviously means a lot to us. Thank you so much.*

(Sarah)

*And it’s cool, too, Scott, that students go to The Meantime still, I mean, hundreds, if not thousands a day, so it must be cool to hear those stories as well.*

(Scott)

*Yeah, no, it’s amazing. I mean, the people that followed me are such amazing teams, have followed since I left, and it’s really kudos to them. They’ve built it into something that I didn’t even imagine when I was leaving, so yeah, it’s the most special feeling to see the growth and just what it means to the UNC community at this point. It’s totally, yeah.*

(Nicholas)

*I’m remembering that that’s actually the first time that we collaborated was on the announcement of The Meantime. We made a promotional video that we filmed in the top floor bathroom of the Campus Y.*

(Scott)

*That should have been the opener.*

(Nicholas)

*Yeah, it was so long ago. It was literally probably like 2016 or 2015 or something like that.*

(Scott)

*Yeah, I can send it to you. But that’s so true that the original promo ad for The Meantime was our first collaboration.*

(Nicholas)

*Yeah, very cool.*

(Sarah)

*And just in case anyone didn’t know, Scott is the founder of The Meantime and was CEO for a number of years and has also inspired another startup coffee shop by Ria Patel for the class of 25. She’s on the scholar media team and did that profile of you, and her coffee shop is Griatitude, but was inspired reading about your story, so very cool to hear that was also part of how you all got together, too.*

(Scott)

*Yeah, absolutely.*

(Sarah)

*Well, thank you so much. I hope things just go really well. It was great to see the news drop that y’all were getting together and doing another cool thing together, and I couldn’t wait to learn more about it. So thank you so much.*

(Sam)

*Thank you so much.*

(All)

*Thank you.*

# The Catalyze podcast: From Capitol Hill: A sit-down with Aaron Hiller ’03, chief counsel and Democratic deputy staff director for the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Today’s guest is Aaron Hiller ’03, chief counsel and Democratic deputy staff director for the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary.

On this episode, Aaron reflects on the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and what it was like to work on the ensuing two impeachments of former president Donald Trump. The alumnus also shares his thoughts on having a free and fair election this November, his legal heroes, and why he thinks college students should consider working in politics.

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Aaron, thank you so much for speaking with Catalyze this afternoon.*

(Aaron)

*Thank you for having me.*

(Sarah)

*And will you share just where we are right now?*

(Aaron)

*We are here in my hidey hole office off of the House Judiciary Committee hearing room in Rayburn House office building in Washington, D. C.*

(Sarah)

*You shared just a few minutes ago that you switch offices when the Republicans control the House versus the other way around. What are some other things that change for you when there’s a flip like this, which, of course, you’ve been here for many of those.*

(Aaron)

*The United States Senate, there are a lot of rules, I’ve worked on Capitol Hill for a very long time. Most of those rules are beyond my understanding. In the House, there’s really only one rule: majority wins every time. So they control the agenda. They control when we have hearings. They control what the hearings are about. They control most of the witnesses who are going to appear at those hearings. The chairman gets to decide what bills move through the committee. We get to decide none of them. It’s not a lifestyle for everybody. But once you figure out how life in the minority works, there’s a certain calm washes over you, and you realize that if they’re going to say no to most things that we put up for a vote, then we have the power to decide what they say no to. And that can lead to some very fun mischief making, good trouble, as one of our congressmen up here used to say.*

(Sarah)

*So most people are familiar with the Senate Judiciary Committee when thinking about confirming or the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court justices. What are the primary roles of the House Judiciary Committee, in contrast?*

(Aaron)

*It’s a great question. We are not on television as often as the Senate Judiciary Committee. That’s true. We’re one of the oldest committees in Congress. We’ve been around since 1813. So our jurisdiction is eclectic. We oversee the Department of Justice. We oversee the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We oversee the Department of Homeland Security, the corner of it that handles immigration. We oversee federal criminal law. We oversee the federal courts. We oversee questions about law enforcement, questions about the constitution, questions about bankruptcy law, questions about intellectual property law, questions about regulations, I could go on. At the end of the day, we’re the lawyers for the House of Representatives, and it’s kind of a fun role to play.*

(Sarah)

*And going back to how you decide what will be said no to, I’m curious what goes into this strategy in thinking about what are going to be the main priorities, and can you share what some of those are for you all right now and going into an upcoming election?*

(Aaron)

*Well, you said it exactly right. We are laser focused on one mission above all others. Leader Jeffries has told us, and Chairman Ranking Member Nadler tells us regularly, our job is to take back the House of Representatives. A lot of that these days involves drawing a contrast between our priorities and the majority’s priorities. Last week, the majority ran a set of immigration reforms that, and you don’t have to take my word for it, as Republican members of Congress saying that those things are unfair, un-American, unjust, cruel, and our job is to make that point over and over again and drive it home.*

*Now, there are going to be issues where we agree. I was in a hearing this morning. The question is about certain surveillance authorities that the FBI and the rest of the intelligence community have where there are some real questions about privacy protections and the civil liberties of United States persons. It was very refreshing to walk into a room where we’re basically in agreement with our Republican counterparts, and I think it lowered the temperature in the room. There was a very adult conversation that was had, and I think it’s going to lead to some cooperation later this year.*

(Sarah)

*It seems like that kind of consensus seems really rare from the media standpoint. Does that happen more often than people might think where there is cooperation and you just might not see that as much if you’re just reading the news and expecting there to be this sense of polarization.*

(Aaron)

*I have two answers to your question. It is definitely true that way more cooperation happens than is ever shown on the news. There’s no story to 90% of what we do around here. We’re doing in lockstep with one another, and there’s a certain just basic running of the federal government, overseeing the federal agencies, we have to do that together. We have to decide, just on the logistics, we have to decide when to be in the room at the same time. That said, at no point in my career, I have always—I’ve been on the Hill for 14 years and change—I have always had partners on the other side of the aisle to whom I could reach out and talk about just about anything. And most of the time it’s the members are fighting in the hearing room and the camera is on, but we got to end this hearing in an hour, so what’s our plan to land the plane? And those are really nice relationships to have. After January 6, those relationships are strained, and it’s a little disorienting not to be able to just pick up the phone and call a guy and say, “Hey, how can we do this in the best interest?” It feels like the temperature is coming down a little bit, but we’re not quite there.*

(Aaron)

*It feels like the temperature is coming down a little bit, but we’re not quite there yet.*

(Sarah)

*I have some assumptions for why a moment like January 6 would create such a strong divide and a line in the sand for a lot of folks. But can you share more of why that had such an impact in affecting these relationships that you have, such that you don’t feel comfortable calling those trusty people on the other side that you would go to for information or for bouncing ideas from?*

(Aaron)

*Well, I won’t name names because we’re all polite here on this podcast. There is no doubt in my mind. I really think there’s no doubt in any honest broker’s mind that the past administration and its political supporters, the things they were saying about the election, which they knew to be untrue while they were saying them, they stood up the morning of January 6 and said those things in front of a crowd that they knew to be angry and armed and organized. And one guy stood up and said, “And now we will march to the Capitol.” And the violence that ensued was their responsibility.*

*I live just a few blocks away from here because I learned at UNC, always live on campus. It’s just a way better lifestyle. My kids watched the National Guard deploy from our front yard. We lived in a Green Zone for weeks. And what a lot of people miss about Capitol Hill is this is a neighborhood where families are raising their children. And we were shut down for a month, occupied by the National Guard because it was not safe to be here. I can’t tell you how scary that is.*

(Sarah)

*Not only for yourself, but for your family, who’s right there with you.*

(Aaron)

*For my family, for my team, I run a team of really smart lawyers who are really dedicated to what they do here. Thank God most of them were not on campus that day. We had to find the people who were on campus and hide them. We had to find my boss, who was on the floor, and hide him. I think it’s understandable that our members and my staff and I would have some hard feelings about that even still.*

(Sarah)

*What does trust look like in your role? And related to that, what does trust with information look like? Because I imagine there’s a lot of different sources and people you could go to. But we’re in the world of politics, and so that certainly would change how you think about someone’s intent in that there could be something strategic. So how do you differentiate and what have you learned about trust and relationship building in navigating these, at times, very tumultuous waters?*

(Aaron)

*Yeah, on the Hill, as in probably most of life, you’re only as good as your word, and maybe you get tested a little more often on Capitol Hill than you might in another workplace. When we make promises, we deliver. And I think all we can do there is lead by example. So I make promises on behalf of Mr. Nadler, on behalf of our team, to different members of Congress, to our leadership, to members across the aisle and their staffs. It is my job to deliver on those promises every day. That’s how you build trust, really. There’s no shortcut to it. You just have to make good on your word.*

(Sarah)

*And I imagine, too, you know, actions sometimes can speak louder than words, and so if you show your true colors, then eventually you might not get a second pass with people. So having that integrity would be really important, I think.*

(Aaron)

*It is deeply important. You’re right. You don’t get a second chance at that. Nobody gets a third.*

(Sarah)

*And back to incitement, as a legal concept, can you break down what that means? And I think we have a sense of what that entails in layperson terms, but the legal world can be very different. And so what was also the conclusion of the committee in determining that Trump had, in fact, incited violence?*

(Aaron)

*That’s a very complicated question, so I’m going to give you a politician’s answer. We should not hide from the fact that impeachment is a political judgment, not a legal judgment. It has been the consensus of everybody who has ever studied impeachment that not every crime is an impeachable offense, and not every impeachable offense needs to be a crime, a state or federal crime. That was how the framers of the Constitution talked about impeachment. They said it would be for political crimes. I wish they had been a little more precise in their wording when they wrote the Constitution, having now lived through two impeachment processes from start to finish. But it was the judgment of a majority of the members of the House of Representatives that President Trump incited the riot that attacked the House. We could get into all the legal definitions of incitement and dissect statutes that were written after the Civil War to get at similarly tense times. I don’t know that that would be terribly useful to tell you what members were thinking at the time. Members were angry. Staff were angry. We live up here. You’ve walked around this building for a little bit. This is our home. Our home was invaded. We were angry. The work felt righteous, and we moved very swiftly. It’s very hard to point to another example where there was less ego involved in coming to such a tremendous political decision. My boss waived all committee consideration of the articles. I’ll tell you, that was not the case the first time around. We were fighting for every scrap of jurisdiction, as was the Intelligence Committee, as was the Foreign Affairs Committee. Everybody had a piece of that one. We said, “Let’s go straight to the floor. It’s too important.” I could tell you 100 stories about members who were just focused on making it right, and that is the tool at our disposal that we have to make it right.*

(Sarah)

*Yeah. How rare when you can safely say that ego isn’t at the center of a lot of conflict, I’d say. And what were some of your feelings and reactions and thinking throughout the impeachment proceedings, knowing that there is a possibility that the Senate would not vote to convict, and in a court of law, you have a case, and if it’s a jury, trial, the jury decides, and there’s a verdict, but in this case, as you said, it’s political, and so can you speak to almost being reasonably sure that the Senate would not go through and yet still having the weight of needing to do this well and right?*

(Aaron)

*I don’t know that we believed at any moment that we knew for certain at any moment until the vote that the Senate would not convict on the second impeachment. I could tell you a story about why that doesn’t matter because integrity means doing the right thing anyway. But you’re interviewing in my office, I get paid to make political calculations. I believe to this day that if Senator McConnell could have found the votes, they all would have held hands and done it. And I only believe he was one or two short. We were right there. If you ask Jamie Raskin, who’s another member who swallowed any number of horrible, he had just a horrible year. His son had just died. His family was trapped in an office in the Capitol during the riot. He led us through that second impeachment. He was convinced that it would be 100 to nothing. He was certain of it the whole way through. And under that kind of leadership, you lower your shoulder and you do the job. It doesn’t really matter what the outcome is. I sleep quite well at night.*

(Sarah)

*How important was the outcome for you, for the Senate to go forward?*

(Aaron)

*I mean, I was arguing for a conviction, and I believed that they should have convicted him. In the years since, the temperature has come down a little bit, and I’m not going to tell you I wasn’t frustrated or angry or sad about the outcome in that trial. Mostly people got some rest. That was really important. We put together the world’s tiniest scrappiest law firm for a month and a half and did this tremendous thing together, and then we all just took a deep breath and went to bed. Any doubts, maybe not all of them, but the doubts that I had about the system at the time and the precise wording, people can love or hate what the DA and Manhattan did last month, I’m sure there are listeners to this podcast who are not going to like what Georgia is likely to do to President Trump. I am sure there are listeners to this podcast who would prefer, for perfectly valid political reasons, that the federal government not indict the President for his actions related to January 6 and the classified documents. But I take great comfort in knowing that the antibodies are at work.*

*The system moves way too slow in a crisis, and that’s a thing people have a right to question after January 6 and sort of the tumultuous end of the Trump presidency. But here we are, two and a half years later, and it feels finally like the measure of accountability we were so desperate for is on its way.*

(Sarah)

*Yeah. What were your thoughts during the arraignment? Were you watching or tuning in?*

(Aaron)

*Yes, like the rest of the country, we were watching that. It’s such an interesting test case. I don’t want to get into the specifics of the case. It’s such a good microcosm for the broader problem we have. I think the broader problem we have in our political dialogue today. President Trump is going to get his day in court. It may not be fair. He has an opportunity to make that case in court in front of a jury of his peers, like the rest of us. And when he says, “Well, if they can come after me, they can come after the rest of you.” Yeah, that’s the point. That’s the point. In this country, nobody is any different than anybody else. And if a prosecutor can convince a grand jury that you have probably committed a crime, then you are indicted, and you get your day in court. There was a time where it would have been unheard of for a national political figure to try to undermine the process.*

*He’s going to get his day in court. Make a speech at the courthouse steps. None of that’s unusual. Go into the court. Have your lawyers make your case to the jury. If you feel like you’re comfortable getting on the stand to make your case, get on the stand to make your case. But to take to social media and say the things that he says about the prosecutor and the judge, horrible, racist, vile, anti-Semitic things that make all of us less safe and undermine very basic democratic institutions, that is not the right way to do it. And you can hate everything the district attorney in Manhattan has done to the President, and still you ought to have the courage to stand up and say, “That’s not how we go about things in this country.”*

(Sarah)

*I’m curious, you have a law degree, and you are doing law in your role, but what does it look like to negotiate success and failure without the kind of clarity of a courtroom in this very surreal, at times parallel, universe of politics?*

(Aaron)

*Well, I don’t know that every courtroom is always that clear. Just to be fair to my fellow lawyers in the courtrooms, the game never really stops up here. You never cross a finish line. Nobody ever rings a bell and says, “Yay, you won, go home now.” It’s always on to the next thing, which I kind of love. I mean, I love that opportunity. I’m so grateful to have the opportunity to lend my hand to the ongoing project for as long as they’ll let me work at it.*

*How do you define success? I have trophies on the wall around me. A note from Mr. Nadler related to the first impeachment. A note from Speaker Emerita Pelosi related to the second impeachment. Outside in the hallway, I have bills that we’ve signed, that we’ve passed here that I helped to write that became law. Those are great trophies of great victories, but not one of those things is the end of the story.*

(Sarah)

*And if you were to distill all that happened with the impeachment proceedings and share with the American people, if we can kind of share as sort of a monolith, to understand what that meant, what would you want people to really appreciate about its significance? Because it was a historical case that we’ll think about every year and just what it means for how we think about the future, especially as we’re approaching an election?*

(Aaron)

*Well, the way I talk about it with my kids, and maybe that’s the best thing to say here, is when something is wrong, you’ve got to stand up. When you see it’s wrong, you cannot stand by, you must stand up. We have an obligation to do that work. There are a lot of people who listen to this podcast who I’m sure find politics distasteful, and that’s probably a very rational reaction to politics today, who find particular politicians distasteful, who would rather let other people handle the problem. But it’s a zero sum game, and if the Morehead community listening to this podcast isn’t more willing to get involved, if people who were selected from all over the country for their integrity—I don’t really care about their political views—for their integrity, can’t stand up and say something about it, we’re in a lot of trouble. I’d like to see more of that from Morehead-Cains, really, around the world. If we don’t fill that space, it’s going to be Jewish Space Lasers all the way down. That’s terrible. We have work to do. I’d like to see more of our folks get in there.*

(Sarah)

*That was the purpose of one of the scholar-led initiatives from this semester was, it was called Food for Thought, and it was to bring in speakers with very different viewpoints in. Do you have any advice for college students as they’re in this really formative stage of their lives, in being able to not just have identity-based politics, but be able to understand and actively seek out to understand other people with very different political opinions?*

(Aaron)

*Well, the best piece of advice I can give you, and somebody gave it to me when I was still right before I graduated from Carolina, is if you have the least bit interest in this lifestyle, if you think you have the bug even a little bit, get up to Capitol Hill and grab an internship as quick as you can. And since I have a captive audience, I will tell you that some of the best interns I have ever had have been Morehead scholars. Morehead scholars, if you’re listening, contact me today. I’ll get you a job today. It might not be in my office, but there are a million excellent opportunities for kids from North Carolina to get involved. If this is what you want to do, call me today. We’ll get you hooked up today. You’ll never look back. And if it’s not for you, no hard feelings, man, you’ll have just spent a fabulous semester hanging out in Washington. But if it’s for you, accept no substitute. And if it’s kind of sort of for you, but you feel like campaigning is more your thing than writing bills, great. This is a great way to get your foot in the door there.*

*And if politics is kind of for you, but you’d rather do it in Raleigh than in Washington, DC, or Austin, Texas, or Salem, Oregon. Great. State and local politics are very important places to be right now. In a lot of ways, some of our state legislatures, that’s the tip of the spear for our arguments for a better vision of America right now. Don’t be shy. Get involved. I guess if there’s another thing, it’s, don’t expect other people to solve this problem for you. The last time I was in the minority, we kept waiting for the cavalry to come. And that might be the moment where I swallowed and decided I was a grown up on Capitol Hill. The cavalry is not coming. It’s us. It’s just us in the room. And I don’t know that, it’s hard, it’s super overwhelming to sit back and think, “Oh my God, the nation’s a mess. How am I going to solve this?” That’s not a question you can fix in an afternoon. You can’t answer that question in an afternoon. But I bet there’s a task in front of you right now. I bet there’s a problem in front of you right now that you know how to solve. Start there. Put your shoulder to the wheel and start right there, right now. Don’t wait. Don’t wait for somebody else to do it. The cavalry is not coming. It’s you. You’re the cavalry. Go help somebody else. The other solutions will start to unfold in time.*

(Sarah)

*I’m sure for many scholars who are interested in having a career like yours, that you’re their legal hero or political hero. I’m wondering who yours were as a college student and who they are now?*

(Aaron)

*Fabulous question. I had the really good fortune when I started working here of working for, he’s now passed, a congressman from Detroit, Michigan, named John Conyers. I’ve been thinking of him a lot this week with the passing of Harry Belafonte. They were friends. They grew up together in the civil rights movement. They were both musicians. Mr. Conyers was, according to the story he told, not a very good musician, which is why he joined the army and went to Korea and then came here, ran for office after the fact. I loved working for him. His vision for this country was just inspiring. And he was one of the very few politicians ever to have been endorsed by his friend Martin Luther King, Jr. He employed Rosa Parks for a while, and just to get to breathe that air for a little bit was pretty amazing. I’m not going to tell you I wasn’t a giddy first year in law school when I saw Barack Obama address the Democratic National Convention, that was pretty fun. And I’m a Texas boy at heart. He has his problems, but watching Lyndon Baines Johnson, watching LBJ struggle with the presidency and the things he was trying to accomplish, he might be the first president whose head I was able to get into and start to think through the big ideas he was thinking. I find him inspiring.*

(Sarah)

*Well, it’s also cool to see from your career path that you’re now a veteran staff member and have just risen in this space, and I’m curious what your aspirations might be, if this feels like a home for you, or if you might consider other plans, if that’s a fair question to ask?*

(Aaron)

*It’s a totally fair question to ask. I don’t want to be anything else when I grow up. I like this. I have just the best boss. Jerry Nadler is a joy to work for. He is smart, and he is funny, and he trusts us to do business in his name. I think we’re at a really defining moment in Democratic politics where, not on every issue, but on really important issues and issues that are in the jurisdiction of the committee for which I work, we are finally winning the argument. And when it comes to gun violence or bodily integrity or how we talk about the police or how we talk about abortion rights in this country, I believe the bulk of the American people are with us. And it is a privilege to get to give expression to what people are feeling across the country right now on each of those things.*

(Sarah)

*And being part of this committee, you work with a group of just really smart, talented people. And back to the impeachment proceedings, what was it like to have the highs and lows together and just being in the room making these decisions, knowing so much is at stake?*

(Aaron)

*Well, the highs are very high and the lows are very low. The January 6, the second impeachment, was an extraordinarily intense experience. It happened very quickly. It was a very personal experience. Each of the impeachment managers involved and all of the other members of Congress, including Mr. Nadler, involved, were all here on January 6, all had their own stories on January 6. I said earlier, we were led by Mr. Raskin, who is as brilliant a constitutional scholar as anybody I’ve ever met, and just deeply was so deeply committed to the cause. I think the country was lucky to have him. Listen, listener, you may think the second impeachment was wildly off base, but Jamie Raskin did a service to all of us. And the fact that he had just lost his son and was willing to do that anyway and did not break while he was doing it is a testament to his inner strength. It was such a privilege to get to work for him. We had our moments. Some of those moments have now been shared in different books that have been written about impeachment by a number of people. One of my favorite was, so we had an opportunity to walk to the Senate floor, and I’m a House guy. I don’t get to go on the Senate floor all that often. We had an opportunity to walk the Senate floor and get oriented. And with no notes, Mr. Raskin went to the podium and started quoting Thomas Payne off the top of his head, The American Crisis, which is, for a certain breed of American history nerd, quite inspirational. And there wasn’t a dry eye in the House. I mean, we would have walked through a wall for him. That was just the best. I wish the conviction had turned out another way, but again, we all got some rest. We lived through a pandemic. Here we are on the other side, and it does feel like the system is starting to right itself. I’m not telling you I’m not worried about the system. I’m not telling you I wouldn’t like some things to work a little faster. Hopefully, it’ll never have to happen. But if it has to happen, I hope the system works quicker next time around. But I think the system is starting to work, and I take great comfort in that.*

(Sarah)

*That’s reassuring to hear. As we are facing another election, from your perspective, what are the odds of having a free and fair one, whatever that might mean?*

(Aaron)

*The last election was the midterm election, and the 2020 election before that was, by every indication, the most secure election we’ve run in the Internet era. As with most problems in this country, the only people who can mess it up are people of bad faith from within the country. I do not believe a foreign adversary—I’m not telling you no foreign adversary is going to try—but I do not believe a foreign adversary has the capability of materially affecting the outcome of an election, nor do I believe there is widespread voter fraud. There are very few instances. There was one notable instance in North Carolina that we don’t have to get into today that involved a former White House chief of staff who may or may not have lived in North Carolina when he cast a ballot there. There’s no indication on the horizon that allegations of fraud are anything but talk. Now, that can be deeply unsettling. But the way to stand, again, the system works. At the end of the last presidential election, they went to 56, 58, 60, depending on how you count them, different judges. Some were Democrats, some were Republicans, some were appointed by Trump. Some were appointed by Obama. Universally, they said, even the ones who said, “We wish you had shown us some evidence,” universally, they said, “There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud here. You’ve failed to state any colorable claim on which we might challenge any of these results. Thank you for playing.” And here we are today. No, I have great faith in the resiliency of our democracy. I just wish the folks who were undermining it would knock it off already.*

(Sarah)

*Well, it’s great to talk with you, Aaron. Thank you for having us in your office and wishing you the best with the next big projects coming up for you.*

(Aaron)

*Thanks so much. I’m a longtime listener. It’s so fun to get to participate.*

(Sarah)

*So great to have you on.*

(Aaron)

*Appreciate it.*

## Episode Transcription

*Forty-two years ago, a young man and woman, twenty years old and deeply in love, had a challenging and life-changing decision to make. Do we stay or do we go? You see, they were facing what would end up being a thirteen-year civil war in Central America in their home country of El Salvador, a decision that over 500,000 people at the time had to make. Do we flee for our safety or do we stay? The next day, they bought a one-way ticket to Mexico, and from there looked for a way to get to the U.S. safely. And so this young man and this young woman find themselves in the trunk of a car with the explicit directions that if the trunk opens, you run. And sure enough, that’s what happened at the U.S.-Mexico border. The trunk opens and they run, spend a dark night running through the desert and hiding in the brush, fleeing for their safety. So with no English, no money, and no family, this is where their American story begins. And despite the odds, they go on to get married. They go on to raise a family and have a son that is a first-generation college student to go to UNC-Chapel Hill as a Morehead-Cain scholar, a Princeton graduate, and now serving as the first Latino legislator in the current makeup of the General Assembly.*

*So it sounds like you guessed it. Yes, that son is me. This story is perhaps why I am hardwired to always look for the roses in the concrete. When you think about what artist and poet, Tupac Shakur, referred to as “cracks in the concrete,” roses that, despite the desperation and hopelessness, can sometimes dare to survive and even flourish. It’s perhaps why I also gravitated to the field of education, where we have opportunities to expand opportunities so more students like me have the same shot in life to make sure that they’re building opportunities for them and their families. It’s where I’ve met students like Mitzi, where we’ve had to spend heartbreaking nights talking about why on her graduation night, despite her being the first in her family to potentially go to college and top ten graduate in her high school, cannot end up going to college because she cannot afford it. See, she’s undocumented, and she does not have access to the same types of resources here in North Carolina, despite having grown up here and despite having gone to our public schools here in North Carolina. But Mitzi looked for the roses in the concrete, and after these conversations, willed her way to get a full ride, willed her way into college, and now is getting a Ph.D. at Duke University. And I promise you, that is the only time that we’re going to clap for Duke University, okay?*

*So you all know that I’m a House representative here in North Carolina, and so we have to talk about politics. You can’t give a politician a microphone during election season and not talk about politics, right? Beyond my work in education now, I’m in the heavy work of civic engagement across our communities. And here, this area is not as ripe right in these times to find these pockets of hope in our communities. When you look at the political climate now, we’re facing global conflict in places like Ukraine. We’re facing the repercussions of a global pandemic that shook us all to our core, and we’re seeing the very foundations of some of our democratic institutions under attack. We’re seeing political polarization that has not been this divided in our recent political memory. But despite these challenges, I still choose to hold on to hope, because in my work now, I continue to see the roses in the concrete. I see it when I walk into a high school classroom or a college environment where students’ eyes light up, and they tell me, “I didn’t know that people like us could run for office.” I see it whenever they shoot me a copy of their documents in Google Drive, because I am too generous with my email, to let me know that they wrote about me in their college essay about what they want to do when they grow up. I see it when I’m door-knocking in communities to talk to constituents, and I come across a working-class family that opens their door, and to their surprise, there’s a young Latino representative in front of them asking them, “What’s going on in your community? What needs can we serve to make sure that we’re building a better life for you?” And they say, “Oh, our voices don’t matter. People like you don’t typically come to our communities to ask us what we need.” And I then go on to have a 15-minute conversation around how we can build a better community together, not just in Alamance County, but across North Carolina. I see these moments of hope when we are building diverse, multiracial coalitions across our community that is determined to address the inequities that we saw present throughout COVID-19 to think about how we build stronger, more resilient schools and communities.*

*These are the roses in the concrete that I choose to hold on to. And as we head into a critical midterm election, I actually believe that the work ahead of us is bigger than the electoral outcomes that we’ll see in a few weeks. We’ll have some of our favorite candidates win, and we’ll have some of our favorite candidates lose. But I will continue to make sure that we’re cultivating fertile ground for all of us in North Carolina. I’m going to continue to make sure that we’re opening these cracks in the concrete a little bit wider so we can make sure we have more stories like Mitzi. We have more folks coming to the table, and we can all have a voice where we can all thrive. I want to make sure that we continue spreading seeds of hope into these cracks of the concrete to make sure that we’re building that brighter future together. And so I’m determined to continue searching and cultivating these roses in the concrete, and I hope that you’ll join me.*

*Thank you.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Ashton Martin ’20 of the USET Sovereignty Protection Fund on championing rights for Tribal Nations
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Ashton Martin ’20

Today’s guest is Ashton Martin ’20, a health policy analyst for United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund in Washington, D.C. The nonprofit is an intertribal organization that advocates on behalf of thirty-three federally recognized Tribal Nations, from the Northeastern Woodlands to the Everglades and across the Gulf of Mexico.

On this episode, Ashton shares about their social justice work as student body president at Carolina (and reflections from the [2023 reunion of former student body presidents at the Morehead-Cain Foundation](https://www.moreheadcain.org/2023/05/seven-alumni-seven-decades-lessons-from-a-reunion-of-former-unc-chapel-hill-student-body-presidents/)), their path to working in public policy for Tribal Nations as a recent graduate, and the complexities of working in tribal law and policy. Ashton also gives guidance in using respectful language when referring to Tribal Nations.

Prior to joining the fund, Ashton worked as the Rodney B. Lewis Fellow in American Indian Law and Policy at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. During their time at Carolina, Ashton worked as a strategy and fundraising intern at Feedback Labs in Washington, D.C., [a company co-founded by Dennis Whittle ’83](https://www.moreheadcain.org/2020/06/dennis-whittle-83-co-founder-of-globalgiving-feedback-labs-launches-two-jacksonville-based-startups-to-help-organizations-adapt-post-covid-19/). They previously worked as a summer investigations intern at the Cook County Public Defender in Chicago law office and as chief of staff for Daymaker, a charitable giving platform led by CEO Brent Macon ’12.

Ashton spoke with Morehead-Cain at a café in Dupont Circle before the 2023 D.C. Regional Event for alumni and scholars.

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Ashton, thank you so much for speaking with Catalyze here this afternoon.*

(Ashton)

*Yeah, thank you for having me. It’s an honor to speak with you today.*

(Sarah)

*And the last time you were on campus was the student body presidents’ reunion. I would just love to hear how that was and who you might have met there or reconnected with.*

(Ashton)

*Yeah, absolutely. It was really such an honor to be back on campus in February for the Morehead student body president reunion weekend. I hadn’t really been on campus that much since graduation, I guess, a few times, and I got to meet several new student, or not new, older student body presidents that I hadn’t had the privilege of meeting before. I am, so far, the most recent Morehead SBP. And then before me was Hogan Medlin back in, I think, 2011. So it was really nice to see people from different periods and different circumstances at Carolina. We also got to meet a student body president from the 1960s, I believe he was class of 1960. And that was just such an honor to see how things have both stayed the same and change in the years since.*

(Sarah)

*Can you speak to some of those big changes or some of the through lines that have remained consistent?*

(Ashton)

*One thing that it was very clear has stayed the same is that Carolina students have always been very involved in advocating for what’s right and what needs to change in the state and the country. At the time, you know, he was dealing with the civil rights movement, and I was dealing with Silent Sam, but the commonality of struggling with white supremacy and racism on campus has unfortunately persisted. But it’s good to see that students continue to fight and advocate for what’s right. And things are obviously quite different. The demographics of the campus are quite different. It’s grown quite significantly since then. It’s a huge university now, and it’s really wonderful to see that, like we had mentioned maybe earlier, that student body presidents have gone from being sort of the same sort of demographic to being people of color and queer people and being more representative of the community that we represent, and it’s been wonderful to see.*

(Sarah)

*And what was it like to graduate in 2020, and did you feel like you were kind of, I don’t know, I think it seemed like you’d feel like you robbed from the last bit of time you had, or how did that chapter wrap up for you?*

(Ashton)

*Yeah, it was definitely an interesting time to graduate. COVID obviously hit in March of 2020. We graduated in May. As student body president, I was looking forward to those last two months where I could sort of let go and let the next person take over and enjoy the last couple of months with my friends, and go to the events that we’d always thought about, the banquet and the graduation and all the ceremonies and things that obviously didn’t end up happening. And it sort of felt like we didn’t get to close that chapter. We sort of all just left, and that was the end of it. But it also allowed a lot of us, I think, to grow in ways that we hadn’t before. Going into a pandemic after graduation is, I guess, sort of like going into a recession or something. The job prospects were different. We all had to sort of reevaluate what we wanted to do and what we were going to do, and I think a lot of us ended up better for it at the end of the day, even though we might not be doing what we thought we were going to do before.*

(Sarah)

*Is that the case for you? You’re now a health policy analyst for United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund. Can you share just what your thought process was, graduating amidst COVID and determining your options, and how you landed on what you wanted to do to start out?*

(Ashton)

*For sure. I studied political science and philosophy at UNC. And then I always had an idea that I was going to go into some sort of policy or advocacy work. I didn’t know if that was going to be actually working on the Hill or working more in a policy facing job. The first job I took actually was at a startup currently run by a Morehead alum, Daymaker run by Brent Macon. I was chief of staff yet there, but I didn’t end up staying very long. I got offered a fellowship at a law firm to be the American Indian Law and Policy Fellow. And I’d honestly never conceived of the idea that I could combine my heritage and my love of policy into advocating for Tribal Nations and Native American people. But in that fellowship, I learned that policy and Native American policy is really where I want to be for the rest of, maybe for the rest of my life, who knows? It’s definitely something very heart centered for me, and I guess never saw myself specifically working in health policy. But weirdly enough, I was pre-med for, like, two years of my undergrad. I liked science. I was no good at math, and that’s really what ended up killing that dream for me.*

*I always liked the social aspect, social determinants of health and the societal pressures and things that shape health care in the United States. And it’s even more of a specific and pressing problem in Tribal Nations and Indian Country in general. And so I’m really quite honored to be able to work in health policy now, in advancing the trust and treaty obligations that the United States owes to Tribal Nations to provide for our health care and well being. And, yeah, it’s not exactly what I thought that I’d be doing, but it’s really quite an honor.*

(Sarah)

*And what was it about working in the law firm on Indian law that gave you this idea that you could be doing this long term and even as a profession?*

(Ashton)

*I guess, first, it’s a pretty niche industry. There’s not that many people that are working in tribal law and policy. But, I had the privilege of working with what is considered to be one of the most premier law groups in Indian law in the United States, one of the first that existed to help Tribal Nations litigating against the United States and policy work. And seeing these people who had dedicated their whole lives—some of them being tribal citizens themselves, some of them not—was really so inspiring because it’s a specific and sort of niche area of policy that I don’t know, it’s just hard to describe. It’s just so fascinating the differences between how the law works for Tribal Nations and how it works with what most people consider to be law work. I’m inspired and energized a lot by just the people that I work with. I work with other tribal citizens. I am so privileged to be able to travel to our Tribal Nations to absorb their culture and their traditions, because even though there are a lot of commonalities among Tribal Nations in our cultures, there are so many differences as well. And our membership spans from the Northeast Woodlands to the Gulf of Mexico and down to the Everglades.*

*And so the diversity in our area and the beauty of the culture and just the care that we’ve always had for each other, and it’s always been a sort of, we’re in this together. This work is hard and it’s difficult, but we’re all doing it for the right reasons. And we’re endowed by our Creator, in whatever sense that the Creator is in your culture, to do this work and advocate for our people. And that energizes me more than even yoga can. It’s just the dedication to doing the work that I love.*

(Sarah)

*It’s very cool to see how you’ve just sought for justice throughout your time so far in your current work and on campus, and just seems like that’s been something that’s backed a lot of what you do, which is really neat to see.*

*I want to ask about the vernacular of how you describe Tribal Nations or if you wouldn’t mind sharing about your own heritage and what you prefer, with the caveat that, of course, it is personal. As we talked a little bit about before, recording and how this is right now, but doesn’t speak for the future and probably changes over geography and things like that. But can you help our listeners have a better understanding of how to refer to some of the terms that go into your work each day?*

(Ashton)

*Absolutely. Like you said, it’s sort of a complicated situation. You’ve heard me say Tribal Nation over and over again. That is what we prefer to use to speak about, especially my organization’s membership. We are comprised of 33 federally recognized Tribal Nations in the south and eastern part of the United States. I am personally from the Sappony Nation. It’s in North Carolina and southern Virginia. We’ve existed there since time immemorial. And then in terms of how we refer to ourselves personally, that is, well, obviously a personal issue. I typically refer to myself as Native American. Many people refer to themselves as American Indian, though. There are also distinctions for Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians. Yeah, so it’s a complicated question, but we really believe that language has a lot of power. My organization specifically, we firmly believe that the language that we use, writ large, the United States and others use to refer to Tribal Nations is rooted in colonialism and paternalism, and we want to fight against that.*

*Yeah, we believe that language is rooted in that colonial power that has existed for hundreds of years now. And we believe that the language that we choose to refer to our membership and in our work, speaking in our talking points and our comments to the federal government, it’s important that that language is representative of our people, that it’s rooted in our traditions and our ways of life. And so, yeah, language has power, but it’s also quite complicated and a really personal thing for many people.*

(Sarah)

*So at the interpersonal level, just thinking of our scholars and being on campus, is the best route to just ask someone if they have indicated in some way that they have this heritage, what their preferred way of describing it is, or what are other ways that students could care for each other better in this context?*

(Ashton)

*Definitely. Well, when it comes to Native students in particular, I always recommend asking how they would like to be referred to. A lot of kids of color over the years are always asked, like, “What are you?” And that is a question no one should ever be asking anyone. We’re all human, that’s the answer to that question. If someone has indicated to you that they have Native heritage, asking, “Oh, what is your heritage?” is a good question. “What nation do you belong to?” “How do you prefer to be addressed?” Because some Nations have specific words that they like to use, and Indian Country, we like to say, is not a monolith. And so it has to be a question that’s asked. And it’s complicated because of, like we said, the colonialism and paternalism that exists has put Native people in this box and also estranged a lot of them from their culture. And so there’s a lot of reconnecting and learning that even native people have to do to unlearn some of that colonialist language and refer to ourselves in a way that is more aligned with us and not with the people who decided that we’re called Indians even though we’re not anywhere near India.*

(Sarah)

*Just like a lot of things in the US, if you look back at the history, it is so estranged from the terms that we use from its original meaning and how we arrived there. But it’s really helpful to hear that context from you.*

*What are the agendas or strategic objectives that you all are trying to work with right now on behalf of this consortium of Tribal Nations? Is there anything you’d want to share about what is top of mind or what’s coming down next?*

(Ashton)

*Definitely. We consider ourselves an intertribal organization. Consortium is a word that’s fine, but it can be more specific. There are consortiums that exist in Alaska, but we consider ourselves an intertribal organization. We have quite a lot of work going on. Specifically for me as a health policy analyst, recently we’ve been working to advocate for a better budget. The President’s budget for fiscal year 2024 was just released a month ago. And since then, we’ve been consulting with specifically the Indian Health Service and the Department of Health and Human Services to advocate for more resources, better resources, better administrative resources. Tribal Nations are often distributed funds and resources through grant mechanisms. But grants sort of assume that we are not sovereign nations, and we are. The trust and treaty obligations that the United States has to Tribal Nations exist on a Nation to Nation basis. And it’s an obligation that exists regardless of our economic status as nations or other factors. It’s inherent in our rights as Tribal Nations. And we believe that grant mechanisms are not fulfilling the trust obligation that needs to come through full and mandatory funding of the Indian Health Service, and more expansion of Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) compacting and contracting.*

*ISDEAA allows Tribal Nations to take over some administration of government services like healthcare or housing, or education and run them specifically through the Tribal Nation and with an indigenous lens. Hard word. And that’s one of our big pushes recently is, well, it has been for probably 30 years, is pushing for more expansion of ISDEA contracting and compacting. And beyond that, my colleagues are working on things like land buybacks, better incorporating Tribal Nations into federal permitting processes. That’s a pretty broken system right now. We have what’s called a Marshall Plan for Tribal Nations. So the Marshall Plan was, in very simple terms, what helped reconstruct Europe after World War II, and it was done in close collaboration with the nations that were affected and that were being rebuilt. And we believe that since the United States has, you know, neglected to fulfill these trust and treaty obligations for hundreds of years now, that real improvement and real fulfillment of those obligations needs to come in a sustained plan that would incorporate Tribal Nations specifically in a Nation to Nation basis, and include a huge influx of resources, financial and technical and otherwise, to help Tribal Nations rebuild from these centuries of discrimination and racism and structural problems that have persisted in our communities because of the actions taken by the federal government.*

*And so, the leaders of my organization are currently advocating for our Marshall Plan. We’ve created a quite lengthy, specific, and comprehensive plan for what a Marshall Plan would look like in Indian Country. But we also believe that it would require lots of close collaboration and consultation with Tribal Nations. And so things like that we’re working on. We believe that the current atmosphere in tribal law and policy is sort of fundamentally broken in ways, and we believe that relationship needs to change fundamentally in order to better and more fully fulfill those obligations. So we have a lot of work going on, but some real meaningful stuff that people before me have been working on, and I will continue to work on for the future.*

(Sarah)

*Does the fund also help with this deficit of resources in making up that lost ground? Or is it more so in the advocacy work and trying to move on these agendas with the Marshall Plan and other things in the works?*

(Ashton)

*Yeah, totally. So USET is sort of a two-pronged organization. USET itself, United South and Eastern Tribes, is a nonprofit that was created in 1969 by five of our original founding members. Even though our membership has varying priorities, we believe that there is that strength in a unified front and that together we can get more work, more advocacy, done. But USET was originally not an advocacy organization specifically, so it gets a bit complicated with the so USET is a 501(c)(3), which is a nonprofit, and that comes with certain restrictions on advocacy work that you’re allowed to do with the federal government. But USET has existed itself since 1969. We assist with technical things. We assist with grant writing. So to your resources question, we do assist our member Tribal Nations in increasing their resources by helping them apply for grants. We have also been the primary grantee for our group of member nations, which strengthens our chances of getting funding. And then we also, since the 90s, have had a Tribal Epidemiology Center, which serves the entire, what’s called the Nashville region of the Indian Health Service, which pretty much encompasses the entire East Coast, more or less.*

*And our TEC, our Tribal Epidemiology Center, does that technical surveillance work and public health support for our nation. So we also have an economic development side. And then the 501(c)(3) side existed for obviously much longer. And then in 2014, USET decided that we needed to form a 501(c)(4), which comes with a bit more flexibility in the advocacy work that you’re allowed to do. So we founded the SPF, the Sovereignty Protection Fund, the C(4) arm of USET, to do that advocacy work and be closer to DC and the work that’s going on here and allows us to be a bit more flexible. And so I’m on technically a separate team from USET, which USET is headquartered in Nashville, and so we have about 70, 80 employees, most of them on the technical side. And then I’m on currently a three-person team here in DC that does the advocacy and policy work.*

(Sarah)

*It seems like there’s just so many different legal restrictions and even just in nonprofit world, what you can and cannot do. How do you stay patient but on mission in policy work when we know that policy has very slow wheels at times?*

(Ashton)

*Definitely. It’s definitely slow going sometimes. For example, last year, Congress for the first time instituted advance appropriations for the Indian Health Service, which means that instead of being subjected to the discretionary budget process every year, where Congress in recent years has come to government shutdowns, and this huge fight over the budget wasn’t always the case. But advanced appropriations was something that people have been working on in Indian law for 20, 30 years, and I was still working on it last year. And so it’s really slow-going work, but when that policy was finally realized, it has made measurable significant differences in the delivery of health care in Indian Country. And that’s sort of what keeps us going. It’s not one of those industries where you get a lot of wins, but you celebrate all the wins that you do get, at least for a little bit, and then we’re moving on to the next thing because there’s just always so much more work to do. But I don’t know, I do feel empowered at times that elders and people that I really, truly respect have been and did work on the same things that I work on, and that something that I do will continue to the people that come after me.*

*We do like to say occasionally that we would like to work ourselves out of a job, if possible. If we could get all the things that we wanted, I wouldn’t need to advocate on behalf of our Nations. I wouldn’t need to do this work. I wouldn’t need to write into the Department of Health and Human Services every other week to tell them about regulations that we think are no good. And that would be the ideal. But for now, you just have to celebrate the wins that you have, realize that you’re part of a bigger cycle and a circle of work that’s going on, and I think that’s really what keeps me going.*

(Sarah)

*Ashton, it’s so great to speak with you. Are there any books or podcast recommendations or other information sources that you’d want to share as pertains to the things that we’ve talked about, for anyone who’s more interested in learning about the eight Tribes in, federally organized Tribes, in North Carolina or in the US, wherever they might be?*

(Ashton)

*Definitely. For learning more about the eight tribes, specifically in North Carolina, especially for those who have the privilege of still being on campus, please go visit the American Indian Center at Carolina. There’s also the Carolina Indian Circle, which is the student run organization, that’s sort of an affinity group, but the membership is open to friends of the community. And the wonderful folks at the AIC, The American Indian Center, are always willing to educate people, share resources. The North Carolina Museum of History also does programming every November, and they have folks that come and educate. And then there are also cultural events to go to. UNC had our powwow in March. NC State and Duke also have them. Go to these cultural events, learn, and be embedded in the community, And then, you know, for other resources, whatever resources you’re thinking of finding and reading, just, one, make sure that they are written by a native person. There’s a lot of things that are written about us, not by us. And that’s another thing we like to say: nothing about us without us. And so make sure that the resources that you’re seeking out are written by Native people, are rooted in indigenous work.*

*One of my favorite books is Braiding Sweetgrass by Dr. Kimmerer. It focuses on how science and indigenous teaching about science, which we’ve always been practicers of science since time immemorial, are combining. And that’s, I think, often given as an example of a good starter book for people to get into indigenous ideologies and things. And then, one of my favorites is an anthology of short stories, speculative fiction about the future of indigenous people, and how some of them, what happens to indigenous people when the Earth is dying and people are thinking about going to Mars. What does that mean for the original caretakers of this land? And the book is called Love After the End, and I think that it’s a really good resource for modern, queer, indigenous people, and we exist, we’re out here. So, yeah, lots of resources. But do your research in whatever resource that you’re thinking of seeking out, but please do seek it out. Not enough people read and learn about Native Americans and the indigenous culture of the United States, and it really is truly beautiful.*

(Sarah)

*Ashton, thank you so much.*

(Ashton)

*Thank you so much. This has been really wonderful.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Skip Griffin, senior associate at Dialogos, on productive discourse: ‘We are much more golden than we’ve been taught to believe’
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Skip Griffin, a senior associate at Dialogos

Today’s guest is Skip Griffin, a senior associate at [Dialogos](https://www.dialogos.com/) and an expert on engaging in productive discourse.

Griffin was a plaintiff in Virginia’s 1964 school desegregation lawsuit; led Harvard’s Black students through the tumult of the late 1960s; and later worked in a range of community leadership roles in public schools, at Northeastern University, and at the Boston Globe.

Griffin received his bachelor’s in government from Harvard and a master’s of education in organizational and social policy from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Dialogos is a management consulting and leadership development firm that seeks to catalyze organizational transformations.

Griffin served as the first Food for Thought speaker of the fall semester. He spoke with Catalyze co-hosts Stella Smolowitz ’26 and Sarah O’Carroll, Morehead-Cain’s content manager, after his talk at the Foundation.

## Episode Transcription

(Sarah)

*Skip, thank you so much for joining us. Stella and I really enjoyed listening to your talk this morning with scholars about how to productively engage in dialogue. What’s the most important takeaway you hope scholars got out of your presentation?*

(Skip)

*Yes, I think the most important thing is if you are the person or person convening a dialogue, you first have to be aware of who you are and what you deeply believe in. And you have to be aware of the things that trigger you and the ways that you react to statements or beliefs that are diametrically opposed to you. And to have effective dialogue, you have to be able to create a space in which views that are anathema or unpleasant to you, that you’re able to hear those, to explore them, and to try to understand them. The real purpose of dialogue is to understand and to be understood.*

(Stella)

*Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And your talk this morning was awesome. But we also know that you’re here to kick off the 2023 Dialogue and Discourse program at Morehead-Cain. And it begins with the retreat this weekend. 25 scholars have already signed up. So how do you hope in this whole weekend retreat, in this year retreat, they’ll grow, and what do you hope they’ll learn specifically?*

(Skip)

*Oh, wow. So the one thing is this morning was just a thing to get you curious and interested. I hope over the course of, from September through the end of March, that people actually develop, they develop a deeper sense and understanding of who they are, what their leadership style is, and how they function in various situations, and what would it take for them to be able and capable to function in multiple situations, especially where difference appears. The second thing I want people to do is to be able to master the skills that are needed to effectively lead a dialogue. Third thing is getting people to think more systemically about dialogue. I think that dialogue, good dialogues require a period of discovery or investigation or inquiry, and it requires you to design to be effective. And so I hope they can develop all those things. And third thing is, how do you, I mean, not third, I’m past way past numbers now \[Laughs\]. How do you build spaces that allow people to feel comfortable and safe enough to say something that they have been reluctant to say?*

(Sarah)

*So you have a very storied career in activism. How did you end up in this work on discourse now twenty years ago since joining Dialogos?*

(Skip)

*Well, at the core, what I discovered in almost every phase of my life is that the people who were able to have dialogue, the people who were able to engage with others or the other were able to discover ways to really shift people’s consciousness. So like, in the early civil rights movement, many of the interracial dialogues were done differently, and they were coordinated by people who really understood how to hold space for people. And in South Boston, doing the bussing in Boston, I mean, it’s like I discovered that the ability to not make judgments about the people in South Boston, but to engage with them in a conversation to find out why they believe what they believed and why they behaved as they behaved, and to see whether there was, in fact, common ground. And I don’t mean by that lowest common denominator, but I mean meaningful common ground. And then, I’ve looked at South Africa after the ending of apartheid with the Truth and Reconciliation, which is a kind of dialogue. And I think I realized that people who create lasting connections between previously competing constituencies make a real difference.*

(Sarah)

Thank you.

(Stella)

*Yeah. And you talk a lot about, like, you looked at South Africa, and I know from your talk this morning you’ve had a long career in activism, even when you were a toddler, when you were 14. So what was your first experience in dialogue about race and racism that you can remember?*

(Skip)

*Oh, when I was fourteen years old, a woman who was a Quaker, who worked for the American Friend Service Committee, was able to gather together different constituents. Well, she was able to gather together moderate whites, even some entrenched segregationists, to have a dialogue about what was going on in my community, which was one of the places where school integration was being tested. And I learned that power, I learned that I could be present in a situation like that and not be overwhelmed. I learned that I could listen and engage with people who had real differences, and it was really meaningful. And I think the American Friend Service Committee and the Quakers who get funny labels, I think they are really good at deep listening, both to others and to themselves and to sort of the invisible voice.*

(Sarah)

*You and your sisters were plaintiffs in Virginia’s 1964 school desegregation lawsuit, which, of course, was a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. And you were sharing about how when we think of Brown versus Board of Education, we think of maybe one case, but you shared that it’s really five cases that we’re talking about. But can you share about just what it was like to go through that as a young person also within a family of activists? Your father was a pastor at the local church, and so you are surrounded by people who were really locked into these issues?*

(Skip)

Well, I would say many things. One thing I would say is that I have a lot of compassion and empathy for people who are not certain that they want to get involved in movements. I was talking with some Jewish people, I was in Israel, and a guy I know said, “We really admire Moses, but I’m not sure I want to be Moses’ kids.” And I would say that one of the things I know, my father was all in. And it takes a lot to be committed to the kind of movement like that. And it takes away from family life, it takes away from the presence with your children, and it requires a lot of you. And then to learn, when you’re young, you think change comes immediately. One of the things that I learned from all of that and from talking with him is patience and appreciation for long-term changes. Things take a while.

(Sarah)

*Yeah, I’m sure that is a big part of your work in thinking about these issues. And they feel so abstract sometimes, where how do we solve discourse in polarizing times in the United States? I mean, what a mammoth of a question. So how do you, in your work, try to make that less abstract? And what are some orthodoxies or examples from organizations you’ve worked with to combat that?*

(Skip)

*That’s a great question. So let me just say that we have an advantage when we work with an individual company. It’s contained, the parameters are reasonably well defined, their mission is well defined. Or they’re trying to come up with a new vision for their company because the old ways don’t necessarily provide the economic rewards they want. I think that I have learned that you have to figure out what the problem is, how it works. You have to love the problem. For instance, I think many people come up with methodologies. I have a way of doing X, or I have a way of doing Y, and they pull it off the shelf and take it to a situation. I don’t think that—you get improvements at the margin, but it doesn’t get a fundamental improvement. I think you have to go in and hold the problem. I mean, literally hold the problem and then look at it, and figure out how does the problem actually work? And then you design and you start to ask questions and design sessions so that people come to better understand how do we get to where we are, how does this really work, and what are the high leverage points?*

(Stella)

*You’ve talked a lot about the problem and holding the problem on kind of this abstract level, but there’s a lot of people who are listening right now who maybe do have a problem and have held it for a long time, but are looking for what are the next steps after you’ve held that problem? How do you start a discourse with someone who maybe doesn’t agree with you and you’re worried that this is not going to be a productive discourse? What would you advise people listening for? What are those next steps?*

(Skip)

*Yeah, so the first thing is, I was working at a newspaper during the time when color was introduced to newspapers, and the traditional newspapers, the New York Times, the Boston Globe, the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, the “Gray Ladies,” thought that color was anathema. It was for comic books. But the people wanted, the public wanted color. So they were trying to figure out how to convert printing presses so that they could at least get color on certain pages, if not all the pages, because the printing presses were very expensive, and it was already clear that maybe the newspaper industry was being challenged. There was disruptive technology. And so the consultant was brought in to speak with the people. The consultant asked all the “suits“ to leave the room, and then he had some kind of conversations. He came, and he submitted his report. I learned from that, that within every system, the knowledge is in a system. The experience, the knowledge is in the system. If you develop a way of, if you treat the people with respect and you bring all the stakeholders, all of the protagonists into a room and get them together, you have a much better chance of a) understanding how the problem works, and then being able to craft solutions.*

*There’s a great movie made by an, I think it was in Raleigh or Durham, North Carolina, that was late to integrating the schools and the fire caused them to have to integrate. There’s a great movie called something like The Best of Enemies, where this black activist woman and the Klu Klux Klansmen ended up being co-chairs of an effort to make this integration work. And some of the black leader’s followers didn’t want to talk. And I said in my talk today, she was the one that said, “If the racist ain’t in the room, there’s not going to be a solution.” So that takes it down to when you encounter a problem. You can do an analysis and figure out who are the important stakeholders, who are the people who matter to this problem, and who are the people who, in the 60s, we used to say, “You’re either part of the problem or you’re part of the solution.” What I have discovered over the years is if you ain’t a part of the problem, you ain’t going to be a part of the solution.*

*It’s not something that you impose on people by experts. In the end, the knowledge of how to transform many systems is within the system. They sound abstract. Go talk to the people, they’ll tell you what’s wrong. And they’ll tell you what they like to see, and then you have to figure out whether that’s possible or not.*

(Sarah)

*You shared with scholars this morning that sometimes the enemy is you, not who you think is the perceived offender. What did you mean by that?*

(Skip)

*So we can get up on a moral high ground. We can say that this person is homophobic, this person is sexist, this person is racist. And one of the things that we discover in working with people, I work with somebody and they say, “Well, the leaders of this company, they’re bad. They do X, Y, and Z. They work with their people this way.” And I leaned over, I said, “Let me try something. If I go and talk to the people that you supervise, what would they say about you?” And much to people’s surprise, they say pretty much the same things about them that they’re saying about the people that lead them. So it’s a cultural norm within the system. So what I mean is, we like to get on, including myself, we like to get up on a moral high ground and say how others are wrong. And I don’t mean this, I grew up in the church, so whenever I start to talk about this, I hear one phrase where Jesus says, “Before you can get the splint out of your neighbor’s eye, you need to get the log out of your eye.” And so many people, they don’t look at themselves. The problem is out there. But the problem sometime exists in you. I’m a man that grew up in a traditional society. Some of my early views about women were shaped by that society, not necessarily the best views in the world. When I talk about equality and stuff like that, I realized I might be part of the problem. I hadn’t thought about equal pay for equal work. We were just talking about the race question. What do I really think about that? I hadn’t thought about child care. I hadn’t thought about, I go ask women to come downtown to a meeting and stay till 10:00, and then they have to walk to the garage and get in their car. I’m big, nobody’s going to mess with me. I mean, they might, but the probability of messing with me as opposed to a woman that’s 5 to 100 pounds lighter is a different thing. I never thought about stuff like that. So if I’m going to have a conversation about how to make this more inclusive and how to make this a friendly place to work, so I was a part of the problem.*

(Sarah)

*I’m also thinking of when you ask questions of someone you like and enjoy being with or vice versa, it feels like it’s coming from a place of trust and creates more trust. Whereas if you’re asking questions from someone you do not like or distrust, then it feels like you’re on the defensive. And so it seems like that was also part of your talk with scholars about the self awareness piece and doing the analysis and discovery process.*

(Skip)

*Sometimes the conversation you have to have is what would it take for us as a group to have a conversation about this subject? So people say, “Let’s have a conversation about race.” But the better way, I think, to approach that is to ask people that they want to, “What would it take for us to have a conversation in this community about race?” And you listen for that and you design the dialogue differently. Just throwing people in a room, good luck with that. I’m not a big fan of many diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. I’m a big fan of diversity, equity, and inclusion, but I’m not a big fan of many of their programs because they’re rules based, “You should do it this way, you should do it that way.” I think that’s a recipe for disaster. And I would say to people— because all kinds of— they’re unwilling to ask certain questions. Like, I think it’s a reasonable question to ask about qualifications. I don’t think that’s unreasonable. And I think it’s a reasonable expectation that it’s going to take time for different people to learn to live together. It’s not just going to take time for men to learn to work with women. It’s going to take time for women to learn to work with men. There’s an assumption that we have not dealt with that the women or the Blacks or the Latina, we have a different notion, that Asians have almost become stereotyped in another way, that they’re not qualified. And I think about several examples. I mean, Major League Baseball was all white, and they said people weren’t qualified. Now, since 1947, if you look at the record books, even if you take out the people who use steroids, most of the records are held, or at least in the top ten, they’re Black players. So they weren’t not qualified, they just had been excluded. If you take the movie Hidden Figures, it’s clear that the American space program would not have worked without the women mathematicians who worked in the Tidewater area of Virginia. So they weren’t like, unqualified. There’s a man who grew up in my community, James Maceo West, a black man who went in the military, came out and went to Temple and worked for Bell Labs, which is still probably America’s greatest creative hub. And he holds 250 patents, including the microphone on the phones we use. Okay, and so he’s not unqualified. And so we have to challenge some of those. We use the case and say, “Oh, you should make special consideration.” Maybe you should and maybe you shouldn’t. But the argument that every Black, Latino, or woman, or other kind of student is not qualified is a myth. So I think that there’s a different way to approach diversity, inclusion, and equity. I’m not a big fan of any rules-based approach.*

(Stella)

*As a last question, what is one piece of advice that maybe you haven’t talked about yet or haven’t touched on that you would like to give to scholars or any other alumni who are listening?*

(Skip)

*Well, it may sound trite, you know, but I think the first thing is understanding your value and your worth. There’s a long story about a place in China, I suspect in Tibet, where they had a golden Buddha. The community was under attack, so they covered it up with mud and leaves and everything. Fifty yea rs later, somebody important was coming to visit that region, and they started to try to just clean it up, and the thing cracked and all the mud fell off. And they discovered the golden Buddha. I think many of us have a golden Buddha, so to speak, metaphorically inside of us. And my first thing is to discover and appreciate your value and worth. Most of us are worth much more than we even know, and inside, we are much more golden than we’ve been taught to believe.*

(Sarah)

*You shared a memory of your grandmother telling you you’re a child of God. Is that a phrase that has kind of defined your thinking on this?*

(Skip)

*Oh, absolutely. And basically what my grandmother was saying, she said the follow up to that is that God was satisfied with all of his creation. He said, “This is good, and I am much pleased.” And so God is as pleased with me as he is with the richest billionaire. He’s as pleased with you as he is with the greatest athlete. You might be a great athlete. I don’t know that \[Laughs\]. But you know what I mean? It’s like, God is pleased with me, and God is pleased with you. And I don’t care what you think about me. I know what my grandma thought about me, and she said God feels this way about me. So that’s yes.*

(Stella)

*Well, thank you so much for being here. We really enjoyed talking to you today.*

(Sarah)

*Thank you, Skip.*

Today’s episode is a recording of a SEVEN Talk from the 2022 Alumni Forum. This talk, given by Bex Frucht ’05, is entitled, “Free Your Tumbleweed Queen.” Bex is the program manager for The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation.

You can [watch all of the SEVEN Talks on our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MoreheadCain/streams).

[Listen to the episode](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/seven-talk-by-bex-frucht-05-free-your-tumbleweed-queen).

More about Bex

Bex Frucht ’05 is a self-ascribed “Tumbleweed Queen” whose eclectic personal and professional journey has taken her from the red carpet to the Rocky Mountains. After a decade of big-city adventures in media, communications, sustainability, freelance writing, and finally anchoring a daily cable TV show and weekly web series—she blew up her urbanite existence to live and work on an 87,000-acre cattle ranch, and has been exploring the intersection of open range and open minds ever since. If it wasn’t for that formative backcountry experience with Outward Bound, she might still be stuck in LA traffic.

Bex loves telling stories almost as much as living them—she’s shared escapades onstage for NPR’s “The Moth,” launched a storytelling series to destigmatize and advocate for reproductive justice, and enjoys helping organizations and individuals wrangle their narratives. As a program manager for the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation’s Montana-based philanthropy, she supports innovative nonprofit programming hosted at West Creek Ranch. Bex also moonlights as an environmental educator, amateur cowgirl, karaoke professional, rainbow influencer, and unicorn believer.

At UNC, she served as senior class vice president and Freshman Camp (now Carolina Kickoff) counselor, and taught a seminar on “The MTV Generation.” She’s lucky to call the funky river town of Livingston, Montana, home, where she floats the Yellowstone with her “Mantana” Kyle Joe, chases their muppet dog Zucca and spoons their kitties—Aldo Meowpold and Ralph Waldo Emerpuss the Catservationists.

## Episode Transcription

*Let’s go! Physical vigor, let me see it. Okay, a little physical vigor to start us off. Shalom, y’all. Howdy. I’m Bex, the cousin formerly known as Becca, and I chose that song because, one, I don’t believe walk-up songs should be exclusive to baseball, and two, the Morehead-Cain website says we set your potential free. So how do you get set free? How do you free your tumbleweed queen? And what the hell is a tumbleweed queen? To me, a tumbleweed queen is your purest, deepest passion and purpose. It is following your joy. Tumbleweed queen is all about B.P.E.: big protagonist energy. B.P.E. is this understanding that you are the main character in your story that you are telling every day. You are the author of your life. You remember Choose Your Own Adventure? That is B.P.E. So, dear cousins and cousin adjacents, I shall tell you how I freed my tumbleweed queen. Because when you get clear on the story that you want to tell, you get clear about the life you want to live. So free, and your tumbleweed queen.*

*When you’re a kiddo, you don’t have to do that. They just, like, come that way. I remember when I was little, I was a highly dramatic show pony of a child, and I loved dressing up. Surprise! I loved dressing up and flair. I wanted to do elaborate lip sync performances all the time to songs like Kiss From a Rose by Seal, unannounced and uninvited into the middle of my parents’ dinner parties. But sometime in middle school, patriarchy, social messaging, teen movies, peer pressure, whatever it was, it became clear to me I was too much. I needed to tone it down. I had to choose smart or creative. That was my introduction to one of the many binaries that bind us and limit us and trap us. But I chose, and I doubled down on overachiever. And that’s the way I saw myself. I remember in my final Morehead interview—yes, I was in a zebra shirt and big old hoops, so the tumbleweek queen was lurking—but when I showed up at Carolina, I was still really framing myself as an overachiever. So I was like, okay, I watched a lot of West Wing. I’ll take the LSAT. I’ll go to law school. I’ll go to DC in a pantsuit.*

*I was not imagining anything like this. And I’ll do something really important. And then junior year rolls around, and I’m picking my internship, and I could choose between the George Soros Foundation in Hungary, or I had heard about this opportunity in London with MTV International, and I was like, whew! Y’all know this Britney Mike? You can tell what I wanted to choose. So I did. I listened to the tumbleweed queen, and I showed up in London, and it was a revelation to be in a workplace and in an environment where it was more about my personality, who I am, than my GPA, and shout out to Glenna Patton for that opportunity. You changed my life. I love you, Glenna. So I got back to Carolina, and I scrapped the LSAT and the thesis. That was a really fun conversation with my family. And I decided to pursue a job with MTV after college, and I was in New York with them. And then I moved out to L.A., the capital of kooky tumbleweed queen energy, like, that’s where you go to get that B.P.E. jolt right to the arm. But it wasn’t really until January 2011 when I fully stepped in to the B.P.E., and I made a New Year’s resolution to tell a story at The Moth.*

*So you might have heard of The Moth. It’s this awesome story hour podcast on NPR, and it’s also a live storytelling show that is all over the world. And I have started going in Los Angeles, and the way it works is you show up, you can throw your name in a hat, and they pick out ten randomly selected tellers to come on stage and share a true life tale from their life. Five minutes long, and it’s just exhilarating. And I resolved I was going to do the show. I show up, drop my name. I was the ninth teller picked out of ten. I was on pins and needles, not knowing if I was going to go. I got on stage with the B.P.E., and it was incredible, the humanity that’s created in a room when folks are authentically sharing and receiving stories, just though that raw humanity was so moving and funny and all the feels. And I really decided I needed to invest in the storytelling scene. And I also decided to start my own story show in a bar in Venice Beach where I lived, and it was called TMI Live. Too Much Information, and I got to hone my narrative craft.*

*But I also witnessed this array of brave souls who would bear their souls on stage, telling folks things they’ve never told anyone before. The profane and the profound destigmatizing and delighting. It was a revelation and cathartic. The healing that comes from sharing your shame and banishing it. And that’s where the tagline for the show and one of my life mottos was born: oversharing is caring. But plot twist, plot twist. The TV show I was hosting at the time got canceled. My boyfriend broke up with me. I got robbed. And then the worst indignity and tragedy of all, my beloved cat who had gotten me through my turbulent 20s, suddenly died. R.I.P. Grover. Love you. So I was unmoored. I was un-Moreheaded. I had no drive and direction. I had quite literally lost the plot.*

*What did the protagonist do now? So I returned to my stories. I had this homework assignment that I had kept all these years. It was from fifth grade. I had this rad and morbid teacher who asked us to write our obituary. And so this is how mine read. Love her. “Becca owned a ranch in Yellowstone country where the wolves roamed free. Becca was found on her horse at sunset, dead.” I was like, that is a story I can ride into the sunset. I had always been a crazy horse girl obsessed with wolves. I had not let that girl… I hadn’t given her free reign in a very long time. So I decided to turn my quarter-life crisis into a Morehead alumni discovery internship. And I found a ranch on Instagram that was willing to take on a 31-year-old, unemployed, out of work former TV host in honkytonk boots. And I moved to their ranch for what was supposed to be three months. I left my Venice Beach bungalow and went to a bunk house on the prairie. And it was challenging and humbling, and I wasn’t America’s next top ranch hand. But three months became three years, and I never went back to L.A. And I had these moments of incandescent happiness where my passion and purpose and B.P.E. and tumbleweed queen was just like, through me and my purple chaps riding the range. And I really credit storytelling and the Morehead-Cain Foundation. The experience was giving me the freedom framework to even pursue that plotline.*

*The Super Blue Blood Moon rose over the ranch in 2018. I knew transition was in the cosmos. Also, my dating apps were set at 100 miles radius, and the horse-to-human ratio was really rough. So it was time. What would a tumbleweed queen do next? What would bring me joy to read on the next page? And I went back to my journals. I had my Outward Bound journal from Montana. Montana had wild wolves, plenty of horses. I headed north. And how did I build community? When I got to Big Sky Country, I hosted story shows. I teamed up with nonprofits and local community theaters, new friends and bookstores, comedy clubs. And the more I authentically shared my story and made space for others to do so, the louder and crazier and more colorful my wardrobe became. I was really channeling that Rainbow Bright thing that my ten-year-old self, like, dreamed of wearing all the time. And I realized, as I put down roots, I blossomed even more. And I also think overshare and over-flair are directly correlated. It’s just science. And I’ve learned you don’t need permission from anyone to wear too much, be too much, say too much, mix till you match.*

*More is more. Because when you start telling your story, you get clear on the life you want to live. And as the sage George Michael sings in “Freedom”—yes, we’re returning to that banger—“There’s something deep inside of me, there’s someone I forgot to be.” So whatever frees your tumbleweed queen, however your B.P.E.—your Big Protagonist Energy—shows up, whichever binary you need to blow up, whoever you forgot to be, reclaim it, and ride that story into the sunset.*

# Episode Transcription

(Malik)

*Hi, my name is Malik. Malik Jabati. I was class of 2019 here at Carolina and a Morehead-Cain Scholar. Currently, I’m living in New York City, working as an associate at a private equity firm, Charlesbank, where I specialize in technology and technology infrastructure investments.*

(Andrew)

*Hi, my name is Andrew Buchanan. I graduated with the class of 2023, and right now, I’m starting a company with three of my friends based out of L.A. We’re trying to bootstrap our team, and we’re called Maia.*

(André)

*Hi, my name is André Ceccotti. I am from Brazil, and I’m now an assistant public defender at the Mecklenburg County Public Defender’s Office in Charlotte, North Carolina.*

(Sarah)

*Hi, everyone, my name is Sarah Mackenzie. I’m from the class of 2020, and I’m currently a first year law student at the University of Toronto.*

(Ashton)

*My name is Ashton Martin. I’m from the class of 2020. I live in Washington, D.C. now, and I’m the health policy analyst for the United South and Eastern Tribe Sovereignty Protection Fund.*

(Stella)

*So first off, what was your favorite Morehead-Cain summer, and how did it impact your life today?*

(Malik)

*I’ll say one, the NOLS experience was amazing. It kind of taught me a lot about just sort of supporting and being independent in an incredibly challenging and new environment, which are skills that were helpful here at Carolina. My first few semesters and years, and especially after graduating, going into different cities, really being able to say, “Hey, I did this. I lived in the wilderness for 30 days. I can support myself in modern society for however long it takes.” So that was a really fun summer. But actually, my first summer after enrolling at Carolina, my public service summer was really exciting, too. There I got a chance to work in Brazil for a rainforest research foundation called Iracambi Research Center, and I was actually there during the Olympics. So that was really fun, like, a good sort of overlap in 2016. But I also was sort of given a lot of responsibility at a really young age, and just being able to create things out of nothing, and even when it seemed really scary at first, it was a really good lesson and a really good experience for me.*

(André)

*My favorite summer must be the one that I spent in San Francisco. So it was my second summer after Outward Bound. I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I knew that I wanted to do something in the vein of law, although as an undergrad, I knew that I couldn’t do anything of too much substance. But I found this legal aid organization in San Francisco that’s now called Open Doors, it was called something else back then. And this was the summer of 2015, and that’s important because that was the summer that the Supreme Court came out with the decision that found it to be unconstitutional to ban same-sex marriage. And that decision came out on, I believe, a Saturday, the Saturday before the Pride Parade that was about to happen in San Francisco on Sunday. And obviously, San Francisco being what could be construed as the queer capital of the United States, and as a queer man myself, that was the most fun I had, and it was just incredible. You could, I mean, breathe the love and enthusiasm that was in the air, and I have that memory ingrained in my mind, and I hold it fondly.*

(Ashton)

*I worked for the Public Defender’s office in Chicago. Being able to integrate with a community that has been left behind or discriminated against in some way, underserved in some way, it gave me a love for public service, putting one’s life in service of a greater good.*

(Stella)

*We talked a lot about leadership and leadership styles, and I’m wondering if you could touch on who you think is your biggest mentor, whether it was here or out in the workforce, and why is their leadership style something that you admire?*

(Malik)

*First name is Todd. We worked together at McKinsey & Company, which is where I worked right after graduating. He was a leader that I really respected in that he had found a way to merge both his professional passions and also his personal interests. He was really passionate about health care, particularly public health care, and he centered his professional career around that path. He was responsible for some of the research and helping implement the Affordable Care Act earlier in the decade—I guess we’re in a new decade now, but in like 2014 era, he helped implement the ACA. And while we were at Mackenzie, he’s a partner there now, but he was someone who really trusted the business analysts, which are the entry-level positions, and he kind of gave us room to grow. He allowed us to present, speak at the big meetings with the directors, executive directors, CEOs, and just that trust and mentorship was something that I really admired and something that I kind of hope to carry forward as I grow and progress in my own career.*

(Sarah)

*I took lots of courses with and worked with Frank Baumgartner in the Political Science Department, who does a lot of work on criminal justice and death penalty stuff. And I think that the approach that he has to using academics as a form of advocacy without people really fully realizing that it’s advocacy is really amazing. I think he does an excellent job of kind of saying, “I am committed to inquiry. I just want to know how the criminal justice system works, and I want to show people how it works. And then once I’m able to show them how it works, I want them to make a decision about whether we all collectively as a community, think that this is fair or not.” And I think that’s a really important approach to creating a world and a justice system that is much more human-centered and much more fair. So yeah, I loved his classes on framing and his death penalty class, and he was my senior thesis advisor, and I really valued all the time I spent with him, for sure.*

(Stella)

*In one sentence, how would you describe leadership, and why did you choose those specific words to describe it?*

(Andrew)

*One thing I’ve learned since graduating is that investors invest in ideas and teams, not specific business plans. And not that investors should define leadership, but they reflect opportunities that society should allocate resources to. And those opportunities are teams that function really well together, teams and communities that function really well together and are cohesive and excited to work together generally succeed. And they’re able to turn failures into learning experiences and pick themselves up, dust themselves off without toxic relationships. And that all stems from having a cohesive group. And a leader facilitates that. They’re not necessarily the loudest person, but they build the best team.*

(André)

*So I describe leadership as an exercise in radical community building. So that’s how I describe it. I want to challenge people to shy away from the idea of leadership as power, leadership as title, leadership as authority. I want people to sort of rethink that definition, that sort of conservative, traditional definition. I think that the most powerful, incredible, thoughtful, mindful leaders I know are folks who have made me feel and made other people feel comfortable, safe, and loved around them. And that for me is what leadership is.*

(Sarah)

*It’s a dedication to building community, which I think is something that a lot of scholars talk about in the program. But I think there’s a real opportunity at Carolina, given where the university is located and the commitment that the university has to kind of public engagement and engagement with the community more broadly. I think you can just really spend a lot of your time at Carolina interacting with people who are really different than you, learning skills that I think are super important, like how to be a good neighbor and how to show up for people.*

(Stella)

*What do you feel is the biggest lesson you took away from UNC, and how is it still impacting you today?*

(Andrew)

*I took away a humble confidence from UNC, humility that I’m going to learn a lot and I don’t know everything, but a confidence to do exactly what I want to do, no matter how ambitious it is. I’ll give you two examples. I wanted to race an Ironman while I was at UNC. I had the humility to know that I would get completely destroyed by the training process and the race, but the confidence to know that I could persevere and complete it. And then that’s translated in my post-college plans because I have the humility to know that starting a company is something that I have very little experience in, and I’m going to learn a lot and make a lot of mistakes and fail. But I have the confidence that I can build a product and a team and create a solution for a problem that I see and potentially succeed.*

(Ashton)

*I’m here for a reason, I have gifts and knowledge to share with the world, and I should do that confidently. Coming from a small town where there weren’t many opportunities, often you feel like you’re not good enough to take those opportunities or go after that internship or apply for that job, but the Foundation did such a good job of instilling in all of us that, yeah, you belong here.*

## Episode Transcription

*OK, this is official, usually scary. I’m Frank, but I want to talk to you, at least for starters, about a friend of mine named David Tatel. He’s someone I met about five years ago. He’s a retired judge, but when I met him, he was still on the bench. He was a judge with the—I don’t always get this right—the US. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C. District. It’s a pretty dense and daunting proper noun, but basically, it is the court just shy of the Supreme Court. It’s probably the primary feeder court for the Supreme Court. Many justices on the Supreme Court have been elevated from that court. In other words, David Tatel had reached the pinnacle of his profession, and he was blind. He had been blind since he was about 30, but many of the lawyers who argued cases before him never knew that or didn’t know that at the time. He had so mastered his environment that you couldn’t tell. When he was on the bench and lawyers were arguing before him, he would move his head to the sounds of their voices as if he was looking at them. He would walk to and from the bench, to and from his chambers, without ever seeming to need assistance, because he had memorized his physical environment so well.*

*I got to know him pretty well over the subsequent years. Whenever I would go down to D. C. from New York for work, I would take some time, and I would go talk to David in his chambers. I would sometimes have dinner with him and his wife, Edie. And one evening, we were leaving the courthouse to travel the eight miles to his Washington, D.C. home to meet Edie, who was cooking for us. And I said to him, “Okay, so I should now get an Uber or hail a taxi or call a lift or something,” because I figured, how does a blind man get home from work? And he said, “No, no, no, we’ll take the Metro.” And I thought, “Well, of course we’ll take the Metro because I’m here. He’s going to grab my arm, I’m going to guide him.“ Wrong again. He pretty much did it on his own. I was walking alongside him. I was walking behind him. He had learned over the years, using his memory, using sound, to do all the things that someone else did with sight. He knew the number of steps from one street corner to another. He knew the number of steps from that street corner to the next one. He could use his hearing to figure out, to listen to traffic and the footfall of other people, and figure out when it was safe to cross the street. So I just followed along, and he led me to the Metro. And he led me into the Metro and through the turnstiles into the exactly right platform. And when the car came, from his memory of the surroundings, from the sounds of the doors opening, from where he could sense other people were, he knew where and when to enter the train. And my sole contribution was to look for an empty seat and guide him toward that, something that strangers typically did for him if he didn’t have someone like me around, because he did this by himself all the time.*

*And as we sat down, I knew him well enough to know I could say something to him without sounding condescending or patronizing. I said, ”David, I can’t believe what I just saw. You are such an inspiration that you can do all of that on your own.“ And he said to me, ”Frank, starfish can regrow limbs, but that’s nothing compared to what human beings can do. He had just shown me that he was proof of that, and I needed to hear that, because I haven’t told you why I met David Tatel.*

*I was introduced to him weeks after I had a rare stroke that destroyed the vision in my right eye. Weeks after, I was told that I would never recover vision in that eye and that there was a 20% chance the same thing would happen to my left eye, a 20% chance that I would go blind. Good odds, really high stakes. How do you live with that? What you do is you educate yourself. You educate yourself about what other people who have been dealt surprises like that and confronted limits like that, what they’ve done to adapt, what they’ve done to transcend those limits. You educate yourself about what people are capable of, because that may well be what you’re capable of when the situation demands it. So do you know that one of the most celebrated, if not the most celebrated, and popular and best selling British travel writers of the early 1800s was a blind man? His name is James Holman, and I can’t believe his legend isn’t larger than it is and we don’t all know his name.*

*He lived in an era when there was no commercial air travel, no cars and highways. He traveled by ship. He traveled by horseback, by horse-drawn carriage, and he went from Britain to Asia, to Africa, to South America, to Australia. In fact, he traveled. He went to all those places and wrote about them, based on what he heard, based on what he heard in the environment, the stories that people told him, based on smell, based on touch. He brought these places to life without ever having seen them with his eyes. And he, in fact, logged many, multiple times the number of miles that Marco Polo did. So if there was any justice in the world, or in the world’s swimming pools, children wouldn’t say Marco to hear Polo; they’d say James to hear Holman. James Holman was a starfish.*

*I met and got to know a man who was working as a sound engineer at a very high level of the music industry. When a rare cancer destroyed the hearing in one of his ears, he figured that might be it for his profession. His ears were his everything. But he didn’t lose hope. He hung in there, he tried and tried, and his brain performed an amazing trick. And he found himself able, eventually, to do with one ear what you were supposed to need two to do. He could hear in three dimensions. He could hear which direction sound was coming from. And he tells me he thinks he’s better at his job today than he was before. He’s a starfish.*

*One of the most accomplished open water marathon swimmers in the world is a woman who didn’t try to do that until she was about 30 years old. And she didn’t do it until she had a horrible accident that mangled one of her legs so badly, doctors told her they thought they were going to have to amputate. It took her two years to learn to walk again. And looking for a new source of exercise, looking for a new source of confidence and strength, she took to the open water, and within a matter of years, she became the first woman ever to swim for 30 infamously dangerous miles from an island off San Francisco through shark infested waters to the Golden Gate Bridge. She’s a starfish. She didn’t regrow a limb, she grew fins.*

*Scientists used to believe, not so long ago—we’re talking about a couple of decades ago—that our brains sort of stopped growing or developing or doing much that was important after a certain age, that we’ve got a, sort of, fixed amount of good stuff up there, and we burned through it at a constant clip. And that was that. In recent decades, though, they’ve realized, no, they were totally wrong. We generate new neurons well into old age. We make new synaptic connections. I don’t have the exact scientific and medical vocabulary for this, but basically, we never stop learning and changing and adapting. There’s a name for this school of belief and this area of medicine: it’s called neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity basically says, we are all starfish. And that is such an important lesson to keep in mind as you age or when you’re young and you’re a student, because it’s a lesson in infinite possibility. David Tatel, James Holman, the sound engineer, I introduced you to the marathon swimmer, you, me—starfish, all of us. What an incredible source of consolation and what a generous and deep wellspring of hope.*

*Thanks.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Ray Sawyer ’13 on re-thinking time management: ‘How do I think about where to invest my energy in the places of maximum impact?’
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

Morehead-Cains at the coffee chat event with members of the Black Alumni Working Group (BAWG) and alumni board on October 14 at the Morehead-Cain Foundation.

Ray Sawyer ’13 is the director of community health partnerships at Well, a health tech and services company co-founded by Dave Werry ’06.

On this episode of *Catalyze*, Ray shares about his path from a small, rural North Carolina town to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He touches on his public service project in Uganda as a Morehead-Cain Scholar and the “happy accident” that led him to South Korea on a Fulbright fellowship. The self-designed curriculum he built in South Korea turned the English block into an exploration of dialogue on poetry and pronunciation, sports and segregation, education, and expression. Using these experiences of innovation, he began working at Google and stayed with the company for more than seven years.

Today, he serves as a coach and consultant for Project Be Better, a startup he founded. Ray describes what kinds of problems he coaches college students through, and shares about re-thinking the concept of time management and what it means to live out holistic wellness.

As a member of Morehead-Cain’s Black Alumni Working Group (BAWG) and alumni board, Ray shares his aspirations for proactive relationship building among the scholar and alumni communities. The alumnus spoke with co-hosts Stella Smolowitz ’26 and Allyson Horst ’27 of the Scholar Media Team after a coffee chat event with scholars on October 14.

## Episode Transcription

(Stella)

*Ray, thank you so much for joining us. Allyson and I enjoyed listening to what you are learning and are passionate about post-Carolina. What do you hope is the most important takeaway that scholars get out of today?*

(Ray)

*What I hope they will take away from this is that this is a space that is intentionally for our Black scholars and alumni to feel like they are part of this community. But more importantly, the Black Morehead-Cain experience is part of the Morehead-Cain experience. We think that both can be true, that people can be proud of their particular part of their identity and also be very intentional contributors to what Morehead-Cain is and what it stands for. It doesn’t necessarily require a duality, and I think there’s been tremendous progress in the history of the Foundation when we think about where we were 70 some odd years ago to where we are today. But we’re most excited about where we are going to the future, the new spaces and places, the new collaborations, the new sense of community that we can establish. And so I hope scholars leave feeling invigorated about what’s to come and excited about their contribution to bringing that to pass.*

(Allyson)

*So do you remember where you were when you first received the Morehead-Cain scholarship, and what was your reaction at the time?*

(Ray)

*I’ll never forget this story. So I was in Greenville, North Carolina. My high school basketball team was playing in the regional playoffs at Menges Coliseum at ECU, and I didn’t have a cell phone with Internet on it at the time, but there was a laptop in the locker room before the game. And I asked my coach, and I said, “Coach, can I check to see if I got the scholarship?” And he said, “No, wait until after the game.” Because his fear was I didn’t get the scholarship, and I’d be disappointed, and I wouldn’t play well. Well, it turns out that we ended up losing the game, and I was pretty down, but after the game one of my high school teachers was there, and she had a BlackBerry, and she let me log onto my Yahoo email with her BlackBerry, and the first sentence was “Congratulations!” And I didn’t even read the rest of the email, but everyone saw me smile, and I remember my dad screaming and yelling up and down the hallway in Menges Coliseum. So that’s where I was when I found out that I was going to have the Morehead-Cain scholarship. It was the right timing because it reminded me of the long term sacrifices that sometimes take place. I missed some basketball practices to come to Final Selection Weekend, and that, in combination with a couple other things, meant I lost my starting spot on the basketball team for that big game at East Carolina. The high school versionof me was like, “Oh no, starting in basketball is the most important thing ever.” But when I look back on history, I’d make the same decision every time.*

(Stella)

*Yeah. And then I know that your brother has been here today, and I’m sure you were saying that he’s the oldest of lots of kids. So I’m wondering if you could maybe tell a little bit about what you getting a scholarship meant for your family and your friends, because I know your brother also has it, so I’m sure that meant a lot to him.*

(Ray)

*My brother, Connie, is amazing. I can’t talk about myself without talking about my family. I can’t talk about my family’s legacy without talking about him. He set such a concrete example for us on what excellence could be, especially coming from Camden, North Carolina. Of the entire history of the Morehead-Cain, I’m only aware of two scholars from Camden County, myself and Connie. And I thought it was possible because of him. I think about the financial realities of receiving the scholarship and that my parents didn’t have to worry about how they were going to fund me going to school. I think about my community knowing that all the things that they invested in me were worthwhile. The coaches who picked me up early in the morning to take me to workouts, the teachers who would let me come to class three minutes late so I could go eat some breakfast. Another teacher who would keep a pillow and blanket in the side of her classroom so I could take a nap after being up all night doing homework after practice, after applying for scholarships. And so my whole thing is my name was in the scholarship, but it was a testament to the community behind me that had invested in me. And that’s what makes me so excited about all the ways I can invest back in North Carolina now.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah, it’s amazing that now you’re paying it forward to the Foundation, especially for today. What was your favorite Morehead-Cain summer? And did it allow for you to reflect on something that led to your career either at Well or Google?*

(Ray)

*Back then it was called public service, and I was in rural Uganda, in Masaka, Uganda. It was my first time ever going international. It was my first time ever being part of the visible majority, and it enriched my life in so many different ways. Prior to that, I was a pharmacy major, and so I was taking all the chemistries and biology, and I was going to go into research pharmacy and find a cure for exercise-induced asthma. I had it all planned out. And I was volunteering in the pharmacy in Uganda, and I’m counting out medicine to pass out to HIV positive clients. And one day, I’m passing out medication, and the head pharmacist is talking to me, and he’s saying some of these people won’t take their medication. So my Western mentality gets upset immediately. “Why in the world would they not take this medicine that’s going to improve their life?” And he says, he gave me a couple of scenarios: “What if you’re out in this remote village and people don’t like that you’re taking this medication so you’re socially ostracized? Or what if you’re a young child and your mother took this medicine, but she didn’t have the full regimen, and so eventually she passes away? Do you now have an association that that medicine killed your mother?” And so to me, that was a gut punch. And it reminded me that there’s so much more to health than doctors and medicine. There’s this cultural layer, too. There’s this awareness and social context. And so I got back to Carolina, switched my major to global health with a concentration, and I switched it to global studies with a concentration in global health. And for me, I started focusing on all the different ways that people perceive health, all the different elements that are a part of it. And that unlocked my desire to put myself in the shoes of other communities, other cultures. That led me to South Korea. That was a happy accident. That led me to my time at Google. But then it all came full circle at Well, where I’m combining my technology experiences with that health orientation of my undergraduate experiences, always thinking about what are the levers that cause people to perceive their optimal health and wellness, and how can we be a part of them actualizing their fullest potential?*

(Stella)

*Yeah, and speaking of Well, it describes the app as a daily health partner for each individual. And I’m curious, what does your day-to-day look like at Well? And what do you really think that wellness means to you after seeing those people in Uganda and after South Korea? What does that look like to you?*

(Ray)

*Yes, I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately in the context of my job. And so, the first thing I’ll say is I’d imagine it’s safe to say anybody we meet wants to live a healthier life. Everyone, in theory, wants to live their best health, but there’s a lot of things that get in the way. How can we remove the things that get in the way of people living their healthy and happiest life? A lot of people know good things to do about their health, but we don’t always think about it in the moment when we need to make the decisions. So how do we surface the right information at the right moment? How do we give proper incentives for people to do the things that will materially improve their health? That’s what Well is seeking to do. In terms of my work, it’s thinking about this technology that we’ve built, this human engagement that we’ve established, the evidence that we’ve proven that we are able to be a partner with people and their best health. How do I create pathways for more people to get access to what we’ve built? How do I set us up that more people can benefit from what we have going on? When I think about wellness, I think it’s the idea that everyone has the opportunity to live their healthiest life. Now, that’s not comparing Ray to the Olympic athlete. That’s comparing Ray to the best version of Ray that he could be. And how do we help people aspire and achieve that element?*

(Stella)

*And you mentioned in your talk this morning about what you’re learning about that you want to focus on energy management versus time management. Can you talk a little bit more about what you mean by that?*

(Ray)

*Yes. In some of my learning, people are saying that when we optimize our time, we typically get more free time in our schedule that we then fill with more things, versus when we optimize our energy, we’re acknowledging that as a human being, my energy is finite, and there’s always a lot of things competing for my energy, for my attention. How do I think about where to invest my energy in the places of maximum impact, the things I love doing the most, the things I’m really, really good at doing, and the things that have the greatest value to the world around me? And so that’s something that I’m navigating now is with the many things that are possible and available for me, where can I focus my energy? And then also recognizing that energy doesn’t translate directly into time. Sometimes taking the time to rest, sometimes taking the time to disengage and do something that’s not productive allows me to be more effective and productive on whatever it is that I’m doing. One thing that I particularly think I’m good at and I enjoy doing and is valuable to others is engaging, it’s facilitating, it’s having conversations like this. And so how do I craft more opportunities to do that? How do I craft more opportunities to listen to others and bring out the good that is already in them? That’s an idea of energy management. There’s some things I don’t love doing. I’m not very visually creative. And so the idea of having to put together a PowerPoint presentation will make me sweat immediately. Are there ways that I can let that take up less of my time? So that’s kind of what comes to mind for me when I think about the energy management.*

(Stella)

*I think that’s definitely a lesson. I know that a lot of Morehead-Cain scholars struggle with impostor syndrome. And I think that’s definitely a lesson of you don’t have to be doing something productive at every time. Productivity doesn’t mean getting ahead in your class or getting ahead in your career. Sometimes it means just taking a rest or just reviving that energy.*

(Allyson)

*Just in one sentence, could you just describe what wellness means to you as a whole?*

(Ray)

*I have everything I need to live my fullest life physically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, and socially.*

(Stella)

*I love that. That’s awesome.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah.*

(Stella)

*So kind of touching back to, you mentioned before, South Korea, and I’m sure not very many of our scholars kind of know what you did there. But you received a Fulbright grant after graduating from Carolina to teach there. What surprised you the most while living there?*

(Ray)

*Wow. Korea was the most American I ever felt. I was introduced at my school, so doing the English teaching assistant program. I went through intensive training in language, in the Korean educational system, in Korean culture. So when I showed up to my school on day one, I had some foundational knowledge of what was going on. But when they would introduce me, I was “Ray, the American teacher.” I had never been purely American before. When I’m in the US, I’m Black American. African American. Some hyphenation of the sort. But there I got to represent what America is. I may have been the first American that many people ever met, and so I got to set the standard of what it was. I got to be the first black person some people ever met, and I got to set the standard of what it was. And that was so empowering for me.*

*The other thing I loved about Korea was I didn’t want anyone to adapt to me at all. I lived with a homestay family, and in Korean culture, a lot of times we would eat out of communal dishes and things like that. Mind, for everyone listening, this is pre-COVID, so a different set the standards, but everything’s in the center of the table. You may have your dish of rice, but everyone’s picking out of the same plates. My family knows that in America, people have their individual plates. And so the first night at dinner, they made a separate plate for me, and I wouldn’t touch it. I ate everything out of the middle. So then the second night, they didn’t make a separate plate for me anymore, and I just became a part of the family.*

(Stella)

*That’s awesome.*

(Ray)

*My Korean was not that great, but I would try to use it as much as possible. I would try to adopt the social behaviors, the body language, and everything like that. And so the opportunity for me to show a willingness and a desire to be immersed in the community was incredible.*

(Allyson)

*And on that note of being immersed in the community, today was the commemoration of the five year anniversary of the toppling of Silent Sam and the creation of the Black Alumni Working Group. So can you speak to why you decided to join this group? And what do you believe are its main goals?*

(Ray)

*Yes, so we know the storied history of our state, of our university, some of the things that have transpired over the past years, as it relates to Silent Sam, as we think about the pandemic, as we think about the murder of George Floyd. And so I will be straightforward that some of our work as a Black alumni working group was birthed out of those instances, out of a moment of tragedy, needing to show up to ensure that our scholars had what they need to sustain themselves, to be successful at Carolina. What I’m most excited about is this transition point we are at right now, where instead of being reactive to tragedy, we are proactively creating a culture and an environment and a community where people feel as if they have everything they need to be successful, where we don’t have to wait for another tragedy, where we can say, “Hey, there’s a lot of value here for this community. There’s a lot of value in our alumni base. Let’s bring that to the forefront.” And so that’s what I was inspired by, showing up for people in the moment, but also thinking about how can we do things before a moment comes. How do we not require a Herculean effort to be our best, but let’s do it just because we’re capable of it. And I’m seeing that manifested in the way that alumni are showing up and giving them their time and their expertise. I’m seeing that in the way that scholars are showing up with passion for what they want to do academically and socially, in their thirst for engaging with folks of different generations and walks of life and career paths. And so that’s a little bit about what I’m seeing from this group, and I think there’s a tremendous path ahead for us.*

(Stella)

*Yeah. And so you graduated almost ten years ago, and I’m wondering, and you’ve stayed very much involved in the Foundation, you’re most like a celebrity in our class because of your video. And so I’m wondering, how have you seen the Foundation grow from we are in this transition point now to be proactive instead of reactive, but what is the growth that we need to continue to do? But how have you seen it grow in the last ten years since you’ve graduated?*

(Ray)

*Communication is essential to everything. So the Foundation as a collective, building muscle to talk about things that are a part of our life, but often don’t get discussed. We bring on the lens of Southern hospitality and politeness and social expectation. There’s some things we just don’t talk about. I call that the Bless your Heart Effect. When something uncomfortable comes up, people are just all, “Bless your heart, and we’re not going to talk about that because that’s not polite for right now.” But the ability and the muscle to navigate challenging conversations in a way that’s not trying to compel one person to take a different position, but to allow civil discourse. We’ve heard that terminology a lot. The ability to be curious and understand someone else’s perspective and ask questions, the ability to challenge our own assumptions, the ability to be wrong is something that is paramount for us to go. And I’ve seen the Foundation make some intentional efforts there. What’s needed as we continue on this journey is always giving ourselves a healthy dose of humility. As great as we are, as much as we’ve accomplished, as far as we’ve come, we’ve never arrived. We never will arrive. And so knowing that as great as we want to be, we always have further to go. And letting that fuel us to have a healthy dissatisfaction of the way things are now, to figure out how we bring in more voices, to figure out how we make sure even across different generational contexts, everyone feels like their perspective is valued, and everyone feels an equal responsibility to evolve. I think those are the things that we’ve done and the things that we’ll need to continue doing to take this thing to the next level.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah, that’s amazing. What would you consider your biggest takeaway from your experience at Carolina?*

(Ray)

*I can’t really tell you too much about the classes that I took. If we sat here for another 30 minutes or so, I probably could call up some reflections from the classroom. But I can tell you about this one particular night where I was supposed to be studying, and I found myself in a room with three or four other students who are from lived experiences very different from me. And coming up from rural North Carolina where I wasn’t exposed to a lot and just hearing the type of conversation that we were having, I don’t think I slept more than two hours that night because my brain was just so engaged by a different perspective. And I think when people say the people is the best thing, it’s that thing, it’s the perspective that was gained and how that continues on. I mean, I’ve gone abroad, I’ve gone out to California, and I’ve come back to North Carolina, and this Carolina community, it still means something. And for me what it means is I’m going to get a different perspective, and it’s going to challenge me to get better. That’s one thing I’ll say. I also got to give a shout out to \[B\]SKI’S (restaurant) because they’re not here anymore. But that was my spot on Franklin Street, where I went, and that was essentially my meal plan. So I think about that. That’s a big difference from ten years ago.*

(Stella)

*Well, so you talk a lot about bringing perspectives, whether it’s to South Korea as an American, or to the Morehead-Cain Foundation as someone from a small town, or as a Black man. I think it’s very important that you’re bringing those perspectives. But I think it’s also important to acknowledge that sometimes when you don’t have the same experiences as someone else, it can be hard to find that middle ground to have a conversation. What are those first steps that you take to ensure that you’re bringing your perspective, but you’re also respecting the perspective that they’re bringing?*

(Ray)

*Most settings, I prefer to start out as a listener, and so my ability to ask questions, to be curious, and then to actually listen. Something I’ve noticed in life, especially in a big family, we talk over each other all the time. And most of the times, because we don’t want to forget what’s on our mind. So when we’re listening to somebody, we’re basically listening for the pause in the conversation so we can get our point in.*

(Stella)

*Right.*

(Ray)

*What I’ve been working on is, how do I listen to really understand what someone is talking about? Not listening enough so I can have a response to sound smart. Not listening so I can give a counterpoint. But saying, “They’ve just communicated something to me. They’ve honored me with their time and with their voice. Am I really understanding what it is that they’re talking about?” So showing up curious, asking questions, and knowing how to listen are important. Now when it’s my time to speak, how do I own my words? I’m particularly mindful of this when I talk to scholars. As much as I’ve learned, as much as I’ve experienced, I don’t immediately assume that I have the right to give them advice. Their life is different than mine. Their current context is different than mine. And so I haven’t yet earned a right to give advice. But I will share parts of my story as information that they can choose to adopt if they want to. I think about it kind of like a buffet. It’s out there. You can choose to eat it if you want. I’ll put a spoon in it, even. But I’m not going to tell you, you better eat this because it’s good for you. I don’t know what their diet is. I don’t know what their goals are. I don’t know what they’re trying to accomplish. And so to me, that’s how I think about showing up with my unique perspective, but also honoring the perspective of others. It’s taking ownership for what I have. But even before I get a word in, am I taking the opportunity to learn about who I’m engaging with? We all make assumptions, right? And so when I speak to someone, when I engage with them, when I listen, I’m giving myself a chance to go beyond the assumption and let that person represent themselves the way they choose to do.*

(Stella)

*That’s awesome.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah. So utilizing those experiences and topics that you just touched upon, do you use these in your roles as a coach and consultant at Project Be Better? And are there any topics that you’ve seen that are prevalent and reoccurring, specifically within college students or current Morehead-Cain scholars?*

(Ray)

*Yes, so Project Be Better is a coaching and consulting firm that I started a few years ago. It came from continuous feedback. I’ve heard it said that if you want to know what you’re good at, what do people call on you to do? And I’m often called on to give people perspective or to listen as someone is working through a challenging decision. Family and friends will call me and say, “Ray, I’m thinking about this new job,” or “I’m thinking about this situation,” or, “Somebody just told me this. How do I respond?” And I was getting that so often, I said, “There’s something there.” And then I thought about, again, what am I good at? What do I love? What’s valuable to the community? I enjoy creating space for people to feel heard because I think about all the times in life where I wasn’t heard, where someone heard enough to give me some advice, but they hadn’t gotten the full story. So Project Be Better is about creating space for people to understand their past, take control of their present, and create their future. And so with that, I work with some college students through the Morehead-Cain, more pro bono, if you will. And then there’s other people that I’ve worked with more formally, and some of the topics that come up are, what should I do next? What’s the pathway supposed to be?*

(Stella)

*Every college student asks that question.*

(Ray)

*Like, give me the game plan. I need to know the next seven steps to know exactly how I’m going to get there. And I acknowledge that that’s my preference, too. I would love to have the full story. I would love to know what the outcome is going to be before I get there, and I can just keep going. But life hasn’t proven it to be the case for me so far. And so what I like to lean into is what is within our control, what is not within our control, and what is the value of letting ourselves have that exploration? I think a lot about milestones and checkpoints. I am notorious for wanting to have all the pieces of information before I make a decision. And so knowing that about myself and my journey, I offer that to others in the coaching space. How can we take an action now, and how do we build in a checkpoint? So let’s say I want to take a new job opportunity, but I don’t know if this is going to get me a promotion to CEO. That’s hard to know. So maybe I define that this is the right opportunity for these four reasons. And I’m going to check in with myself in a month, in three months, six months, in a year. I’ve given myself these milestones, and I’ve given myself some criteria. Am I learning? Am I being valued? Is this a safe environment for me to be successful? Am I doing something that is impactful? And on month one, yeah, it’s great. Month three is still feeling good. Month six, I have some challenges, but I’m still excited about, and I get to a year, and these things are amazing, and these things are not. So now I know where to focus my energy, and so that prevents me from looking up ten years from now and saying, “How did I get here?” But it also gives me permission in between the milestones to just fully engage in the present experience and not be weighted down by the pressure of having the perfect pathway. So that’s one of the topics that I think comes up.*

(Stella)

*No, that’s great. We really appreciate you for joining us, for talking all the way from Carolina to South Korea, all the way up to Well and your work at Project Be Better, and we’re hoping that scholars will resonate with your stories, and I’m sure they will. So we really appreciate you. Thank you for your time.*

(Ray)

*It’s a pleasure to be here today. Thank y’all so much for allowing me to share this space.*

(Stella)

*Of course. Thank you.*

# Episode Transcription

*For my Outdoor Leadership experience prior to starting my first year at Carolina, I signed up to trek the Wind River Range in Wyoming.*

*While I considered myself outdoors certified, finding myself pitching my tent in snow on the second night, and not seeing dry land again until the penultimate night in the wilderness, was, to say the least, humbling.*

*When the first thing I had to do each morning was to take my piton hammer and break open my frozen boots so I could get my feet wrapped in wet socks inside in this frozen purgatory, I often wondered if the other Morehead-Cain Scholars were so profoundly miserable. I hoped they were.*

*On the day we passed the last summit, the sun was almost blinding as it reflected so* *intensely from the snow and the thin air. We were on our way down the pass, and I was thinking, this is going to be over in less than a week. It was a good day.*

*In the distance, we saw a guy walking up the mountain, alone, with only a day pack and a water bottle. Who is this guy and what the heck was he doing?*

*As he approached, we saw that his face was as red as ours and he had a big smile. Okay, this is a legit mountain dude.*

*“Hey, are any of y’all Morehead Scholars?” he boomed in a thick, southern drawl.*

*Without hesitation I went up to him and blurted out, “I am, I am,” thinking maybe Mebane Pritchett, our executive director at the time, had finally realized this was all a terrible mistake and this guy was here to helicopter me to a spa in Jackson Hole.*

*“What are you doing here?” I asked. He responded as if he was having the time of life.*

*“l left a button at the last campsite and the instructors told me where it was, and I had to go back and get it,” he said.*

*Wait, you’re doing what? And you’re smiling?*

*In an instant I thought, “Oh, this is how Morehead Scholars respond to adversity. I am so screwed!”*

*If I had been told to go back over a mountain pass, alone, to get a button I accidentally left at some random campsite that I’d surely never find again, l would have given the scholarship back at the nearest pay phone.*

*After a few minutes, Andy went on his way trekking up the mountain and it hit me.*

*I am one of a group of very special people, and I was given this opportunity for a reason. I never forget that lesson.*

*We all have stories about how Carolina, Morehead-Cain, and other scholars impacted our lives in ways that to this day we haven’t fully appreciated.*

*Today, I have a request. Think about how the Morehead-Cain Scholarship changed you, made you a better person, and gave you opportunities and connections that you would not have had otherwise.*

*[The Day of Giving](https://catalyze.simplecast.com/episodes/a-friendship-forged-in-the-wilderness-david-von-storch-80) is coming up on November 17. I’m going ask you to join us in supporting the very special and important work of the Morehead-Cain Foundation.*

*I hope you connected to my story in some way and you are reminded of the special role the Foundation and its universe of people have played in your life. Thanks for listening.*

## Episode Transcription

*I’ve been going through something. Eighty days, I’ve been going through something. I’ve been growing a mustache. As a Vietnamese person, it’s been incredibly trying. Growing facial hair is one of the toughest challenges my people have faced, right under colonization and civil war. Many people told me it wasn’t my calling, but why wasn’t that for me? Everyone was a doubter of what started as a wispy rat on my face, but I had a vision for what it could be, a luscious mustache that would make Montez jealous of me. Whenever people doubt, I become shamelessly stubborn. This shameless stubbornness has led to the things I’m most proud of. You always have skeptics. Not because you’re wrong, necessarily, but because you carry a vision that others can’t see.*

*Now, if you haven’t picked up on it yet this weekend, I have what’s been described to me as “squirrel on caffeine energy.” Not typically what we see in public office. So when I ran, I sought out the pioneers in Chapel Hill that ran us first. And I kept hearing the same refrain, “Town council? That’s a bit ambitious for you, eh?” And I’d be like, “Bruh, it’s town council.” It’s not state level office. I’m no Ricky Hurtado, I get that. Many questioned why I was even running, but I had a vision to make Chapel Hill a place where people of all backgrounds could afford a home and provide for their families. Political fundraising as a twenty-two-year-old senior sucks. The maximum individual contribution I could take was $350. I didn’t have a bunch of rich friends who could just write a check for that. I had homies waiting for Pint Night at He’s Not. So I took donations from UNC alum who I knew, a few of whom happened to be developers. Suddenly, a Chapel Hill PAC was screaming, “Tai’s being bought out by developers! He’s corrupt!” And I had a simple response, “If you think I could be bought for $350, you should not vote for me. I cost at least $12,000 a semester. Right, Morehead?” And how could I be in anybody’s pocket when my vision was rooted in my own community? And the proof is in the pudding because my corrupt ass is killing it. My council has approved more affordable housing units in this town than all previous councils combined. We created a workforce development program that serves marginalized youth from refugee families like my own that is the first of its kind in this county.*

*But it’s not always the skeptics who steer you wrong. Sometimes it’s those folks that offer well-intentioned advice. As if graduating as a global pandemic was beginning wasn’t difficult enough, I decided to start a company with two classmates. As the world was grinding… or halting, we were grinding. We lived in a duplex at the bottom of the hill. It had no sunlight and flooded constantly. We paid ourselves $750 a month, a far cry from my Morehead stipend. Rent was #350, and I was on a ramen and O.J. diet. On top of that, our business model was a bust. Our original customers, government, were in emergency mode, and engaging with us was literally the last thing they wanted to do. The well-intentioned advice we received was to start looking for jobs in the real world or to sell our business to someone who had money. We were a market research firm one week and then a pharmaceutical drug trial assistance company the next. We had no idea what we were doing.*

*Our original vision was to make government work better for people. We decided it wasn’t worth working on a startup. Just to work on a startup, you have to be rooted in a vision. So we went back to government, found a problem they couldn’t keep living with, and we’ve built a five million dollar business out of it. The vision was rooted in relationships I formed during my infamous Civic Collab summer in Greensboro and my time on council. Nothing was going to stop me from giving back to the local government officials who make our communities work.* *So you always have naysayers on your journey, and that’s why it’s so important to identify those around you who can see a spark and take a bet on you. 21 Savage has a song that I love called Letter to My Mama. This is my letter to those who took a bet on me, who saw it: Picasso behind the squirrel.*

*Dear Mr. Archie, my 5000 Role Models of Excellence mentor, you dealt with me as a young lad in behavioral remediation. You showed me an example of someone, no matter how successful you got, you always found time to give back to rough-around-the-edges lads like me.*

*Dear Miss Bailey and all my rocks in this community, you took in a hyper student and showed me what it means to be a public servant.*

*Dear JC Hudgison, chief building official for the city of Tampa, you took a huge bet on our startup from a cold email I sent you after hearing you on a podcast. And by doing so, you put our business on a whole new trajectory.*

*Dear Morehead-Cain, your scholarship has allowed my family to escape a cycle of small visions rooted in survival. We’re a refugee family, and this scholarship is the whole reason I can even grow a mustache in the first place. Just kidding. It’s the reason I can dream and do crazy things like serve in public office and build a business. You invested in me, and now I can invest in others. And that’s what this scholarship is and what community means. It’s both an investment and a duty to invest in others.*

*That’s the part where I get a little emotional, because here’s my letter to my mama. The woman who had to leave her homeland, work 80-plus hour weeks to make ends meet, on top of cooking daily, taught me to always show up for others. And most importantly, to be unapologetically myself. If any of you have had the honor of meeting my mom, you’ll know, she’s pretty unique. She embodies shameless stubbornness perfectly. There are no social norms, no societal rules she wouldn’t shatter to take care of her own. She’s constantly saying what’s on her mind, asking others what they need, and is the life of any room she walks into. I strive to be more like her every day. I’m only saying this here because I don’t think I could ever fully convey this to her. As Ocean Vuong says, “To speak in our mother tongue is to speak only partially in Vietnamese, but entirely in war.” And if I was as fluent in war as her, I would tell her, “All that I am, all that I will ever accomplish, all that I can even strive for, is because of your sacrifice. The sacrifice of a woman from a small rural village in Vietnam who had no formal education, no wealth, and yet wielded a courage and resilience envied by the greats. Every day when I wake, no matter the weight on my shoulders, I know I can bear it because you bore it first, Ma, you never left my side, and I thank you.”The Catalyze podcast: SEVEN Talk, by Tai Huynh ’20*

# Episode Transcription

(Chesca)

*Yeah, I’m Chesca Colloredo-Mansfeld. I was in the class of 1987, way back when, and I founded an organization called MiracleFeet, which I ran as the CEO for the last 13 years. And right now, I’m at this moment of transition, and someone else is taking over, which is exciting and also terrifying.*

(Caroline)

*Okay, I’m Caroline Lowry. I live in Seattle, Washington, and I’m a product manager at Amazon.*

(Cecilia)

*My name is Cecilia Polanco. I’m a UNC Morehead, class of 2016. And currently, I am the director of community growth and outreach at Pupusas for Education/People for Equity. That’s a whole story.*

(Jane)

*Yes, I’m Jane Summers Kelly, class of ’85. I currently run my own business, JSK Business Consulting, which coaches teams and their leaders, and also I run a CEO peer group.*

(Pavani)

*Hey, my name is Pavani Peri, class of 2020, and I’m a co-founder and COO of Acta Solutions.*

(Benny)

*In your role, what is something that makes you lose track of time because it’s so captivating or engaging?*

(Cecilia)

*I’m really grateful that right now I get to innovate and create a lot. I’m doing a lot of problem solving as we are building and growing, so we’re experiencing growing pains. But everywhere we have attention points, an issue, or somewhere where there’s something to be resolved, that’s where I like to dig in. So I’m enjoying working with a team to build the team, grow the team, help folks get to where they want to be as far as their growth, whether it’s personal or professional, and building new things. I think with Papusas for Education evolving into People for Equity, I get to bring my visions to life. So, I love problem solving. I love being in the clouds of what is possible and freedom dreaming. And then the work of bringing that into reality is really what’s driving me to keep going every day.*

(Jane)

*I’m lucky to do what I love after five different career steps, and what captivates me is working with a business leader and getting him to think through what’s not working from a business point of view, and the people element of that business point of view, but anchoring it, learning about his business. One, I love learning; two, helping him anchor possible changes, benefits from a business point of view. How many hours would you save if your team did this differently? Why would this be of benefit? So, getting him to believe it’s worth the change?*

(Benny)

*We have the privilege of speaking with incredible women entrepreneurs today at this Coffee Chat. Who is someone that guides your thinking and that has shaped you, a role model of yours?*

(Jane)

*Benny, I actually don’t have a role model that’s doing exactly what I do. The role model I have is a woman who was one of the first in her position as the female head of the World Bank, Christine Lagarde. And 15 years ago at INSEAD, we were, before she became that, we were thinking of hiring her. So I got to interview her and she was not interested, but she was both strong and smart but didn’t make others feel dumb. And she was willing to risk her career to do things that she was passionate about. And I just so respected that backbone, as well as her savvy global business understanding and ability to work in a room of men and not need to prove herself.*

(Caroline)

*I feel like there’s such a trend around, like cancel culture. I had to be careful who I pick because there’s a lot of like conflicting figures out there. And I feel like there was a whole group of women entrepreneurs that were really inspiring to me, who all have been, like, defamed in certain ways.*

(Benny)

*Interesting. How does it make you feel?*

(Caroline)

*It’s sad because I feel like so much of their downfall was because of ways they were breaking barriers. I’m thinking of like Ty Haney at Outdoor Voices, Emily Weiss at Glossier, the woman who ran Away, the suitcase company, like all of these, like direct-to-consumer brands that were like. So I looked at those women, and I was like, “You guys are power women, this is amazing.” And then there was like a three month period where every single one of them got kicked out of their companies. The companies were taken over by institutional investors, and it was really hard for me because I was like, wait, these are women I looked up to? What do you mean? They’ve created a terrible, a toxic working culture. And so much it was like, is it because they’re women? Like, I’m pretty sure Elon Musk’s Tesla has a worse working culture. Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin is crucified all the time. But no one comments on, people will say like, “Oh, the working culture is bad,” but no one says , “Oh, it’s because of Jeff Bezos.” And I feel like it was tough to watch. Many women entrepreneurs get kicked out of their companies when they built these really amazing, interesting brands. And part of me was like, is it because they’re women, or is it because they actually did make these toxic work environments and failed their shareholders, failed their customers, failed their employees? Did they actually fail or is it because they were held to unreasonable standards?*

(Pavani)

*I would say my dad. So he came to this country and didn’t really know what he was going to do. And he has always been super entrepreneurial, but just because of his circumstances and the fact that he didn’t have resources, he couldn’t. Like when you ask him today what he would have done if money was no object, he says he would be a writer and an entrepreneur. And I think growing up hearing that, it was really clear to me that that was something that I would be able to do and should do if given the option.*

(Cecilia)

*So currently, a role model for me is AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Just because she’s such a badass and she is showing up in very challenging ways through her role in Congress. And so for one, it’s great to see some representation like that is still something that is needed, especially, I would say for me, like for me, in order to see myself in spaces, I’m used to being the first one, the only one. It’s great to see examples like that. And she has this fearlessness about her to challenge things. I love how educated and articulate she is, and she’s coming from a really, you could say, a humble background, but from the lived experience of being somebody out here working to make a living, pursuing an education, and for her to be at those levels, representing the voices of a lot of people who are not always represented. Challenging systems, challenging big corporations, asking challenging questions in such an educated and articulate way, I want to be at that level where I can keep my calm, even when there’s tension and conflict. I want to be able to move through that really gracefully. So I’ve seen some of her speeches, some of the questions, the line of questioning she has. And I’m like, wow, I want to be on that level to ask the right questions and be able to move through it with a lot of grace and calm.*

(Benny)

*When you think about where you are today, is there a summer experience that you had at the Morehead-Cain that pushed you in the direction you are today, and maybe a reflection on that summer?*

(Jane)

*Two of them allowed me to know I didn’t want to go into. I worked at Coors Brewery in their marketing department, and I learned I didn’t want to go into marketing. The one that really helped me focus my first 11 years of a career was Chase Bank in Paris. Sounds sexy, but it was, I really got to understand how much you assess businesses in finance. And I loved the business aspect and understanding each business. So, that had me apply to the traditional banking New York JP Morgan route. And that’s not, it didn’t it didn’t get me to the leadership consulting I’m doing now, but it did hone my business acumen and allow me to then transition into the softer side of business because I understood their context. So it was a grounding. Today’s generation is aware, I need to find what I enjoy, so I’d say 70 percent—I live off right off campus, and so I interact with a lot of students—70 percent of them are willing to buck the respected consulting high salary, and it can be harder to find it, so that they need to do more info interviews to find that niche and find what they love.*

(Caroline)

*So, my NOLS trip was pretty influential. I credit that with how I ended up in Seattle. I flew through Seattle on the way out to Alaska, and I remember flying over Mount Rainier and all the volcanoes out there, and having never seen anything like five volcanoes in a line all next to each other, and thinking like, this is the most insane place coming from Charleston, South Carolina. Okay, so yeah, no volcanoes, no volcanoes, only a bridge, which was like our largest hill in the area. So seeing a volcano, like a snowy, true mountain volcano, was unbelievable. And then looking left and seeing the Olympics, looking right and seeing the North Cascades. There are fewer places, I think, that are that beautiful in the world. Until I went to Alaska, and then I was like, oh, it gets bigger, the mountains get bigger. So that was pretty crazy. And then I’d never gone camping until I went for 30 days in the backcountry.*

*So I feel like I learned a lot, trying new things, just jumping in headfirst. I will surprise myself if I try new things, and I feel like that was the ultimate get out of my comfort zone. And I think growing up in small-town South Carolina, to then be forced out of my comfort zone in that dramatic of a fashion, I think really set the tone for the rest of my Morehead experience, which was just like, say yes, do it, get out of your comfort zone, and interesting things will happen. It sort of was like the motto, I feel like, for my Morehead experience, but also kind of for the rest of my life. When I was like, “Oh, do you want to move to Charlotte, North Carolina, or do you want to go to Seattle, Washington?” And I was like, “I want to go west.” So yeah, it made it—I feel like after that experience, my capacity for what I knew, I was like, “Wow, I actually know very little. I’ve seen very little. And I want to see more of it.” So yeah, I think my NOLS course, in retrospect, was way more influential.*

(Benny)

*Interesting. Yeah.*

(Caroline)

*And I’ve come to appreciate it. Like took me a long time to get there.*

(Benny)

*Yeah. It was an intense experience.*

(Caroline)

*Yeah, I came to really appreciate it. And I was like, “Oh, I learned how to set up a tent and pack my backpack and eat powdered potatoes.” That was great. And then it was many years later where I was like, “Actually, this is why I ended up in Seattle and why I love to hike and climb, and ski and do all these activities and trail run and push myself in this way is because when I was 18, I learned like, oh, I can do these things, and I can try new things, and I can be really, really, really bad at these things on day one and learn how to get better at them.” So yeah, I love NOLS.*

(Benny)

*What are you most prideful about when you look back on your time? And then, what are you thinking about for the next immediate future to fill your day?*

(Chesca)

*Well, I think what I’m most proud of is the the daily impact that MiracleFeet was able to have on children’s lives and on family’s lives. My day-to-day experience as the CEO was often quite removed from that. Managing legal issues or financial issues or building a team, et cetera, that again, might be not that different than a corporate entrepreneurial venture. The piece that was so rewarding was when I would go to clinics around the world and watch and observe families getting treatment. They didn’t know who I was, and they didn’t know my role, but to see this well-oiled machine happening, and then to see the joy on the families’ faces, especially the mothers, and to see these kids just running around who previously wouldn’t have been able to walk, that was what drove me and motivated me, and I found that I had to go and visit clinics, sort of on a regular basis to refuel my own motivation and enthusiasm and energy for doing the work. So that was the really exciting part.*

*In terms of what I’m going to do next, I have no idea. It’s very, very exciting to be able to hand something off and feel really confident about it. But it’s also really hard because I’ve poured my heart and soul into this for 13 years, and suddenly, I’m no longer that person. And yet, my identity has, in some ways, been tied up with it for a while, and I’m having to detach. So I’m very excited for the opportunity to kind of step back, spend some time thinking and trying to figure out what is the next role and what is the next issue. I’m torn between sort of just really building on and sharing the experience I’ve gained from MiracleFeet, which is in a sort of global health space, and just using that knowledge and experience to help others build organizations versus switching. And the thing that’s really pulling at me is climate change. And it just seems so urgent. But I don’t know anything about climate change other than being an avid reader and following what’s going on. But that’s, I think, is what I’m grappling with right now is like, do I try to actually switch to a totally different issue that I feel is the urgent issue of our time?*

# Episode transcription

(Benny)

*Thank you, Chris, for being here. It’s November 2023. Last night was our Fall Banquet, where we had a chance to reflect on the past year and some of the incredible new initiatives that Morehead-Cain has taken on. We also had the chance to welcome in the class of ’26, which is our inaugural cohort of second-year students. Chris, could you talk about the Sophomore Selection process?*

(Chris)

*Thank you for having me here, Benny. It’s great to be in the room with you, and it’s a really exciting day. As you know, last night was our Fall Banquet, where we not only heard some amazing speeches from some current seniors but also had the chance to formally welcome the class of 2027 and welcome 15 new scholars in the class of 2026, our first class through Sophomore Selection. And it has been amazing to see the impact that these young students have already had on UNC-Chapel Hill over the course of their first year and a bit on campus.*

*As you might know, we invited faculty, staff, and TAs from across campus, from the community, to nominate students on campus who they thought had the potential to shape the future of UNC and to shape the world. And we received 159 nominations of sophomores at UNC. They included transfer students, they included young researchers, they included decorated leaders, and to my surprise, the vast majority of them had never previously been in the Morehead-Cain pipeline. Morehead-Cain’s mission is to identify, invest in, and empower future leaders. And this is not a second chance to apply for Morehead-Cain, but it’s a second chance for Morehead-Cain to identify extraordinary talent and to identify that talent early enough in their UNC journey in which we can meaningfully invest in young leaders and transform their trajectory to impact here and in a lifetime of leadership beyond here.*

*I have really enjoyed getting to know the 15 new scholars. They are Morehead-Cain scholars in every sense of the word. As one of our trustees, Holly Gwynne-Timothy, said when she met them, “These are scholars who just didn’t realize it until the start of their sophomore year, but in every way, they are like you and your classmates and those who have come before you for the past 70 years.”*

(Benny)

*That’s wonderful. I know I was personally very excited to hear about the initiative, hear friends who said, “I just got nominated to be a sophomore scholar,” and talk them through that process. I would love to know how this came about and what were some of the earliest conversations.*

(Chris)

*If we rewind the clock about 18 months, we spent considerable time asking ourselves, “How might we maximize our impact on the world when the Foundation turns 100 in 2045?” And it struck us that that maximization of our impact includes both identifying a broader group of extraordinary leaders, transforming the way in which we invest in them through an experience that really reimagines college, and also investing in and connecting an intergenerational community that works together to shape the future of North Carolina, of the United States, and indeed, of the whole world. And as we explored different opportunities that might be in front of us to either shape our selection process or shape the way in which we think about college, we also recognized that there might be opportunities to expand our pipeline, not just by adding high school students, but by thinking about who might have never had the opportunity to be Morehead-Cains but should be here. And if they had the opportunity to enter our community, who might have a transformational impact at UNC and beyond, consistent with our mission.*

*What I discovered that I wasn’t expecting, Benny, was the way in which this initiative would transform our relationships across the University. We are reaching out to faculty members, staff members, to the admissions office that reads transfer applications, and we are asking them, “Who do you see that you believe has transformative leadership potential?” And unsurprisingly, we heard many stories about current Morehead-Cain Scholars that they didn’t know were Morehead-Cain Scholars. But we also heard many stories about young people that we’d never had the chance to meet before, and to see them enter this community and to recognize the impact that they might have as a result of opportunities to go abroad for the first time, opportunities to engage in professional experiences that are unbounded by the need for financial remuneration or to explore a research interest with a Lovelace Fund grant. That’s really exciting to me.*

(Benny)

*It’s great to hear the context of not only how the initiative came about, but also the way that it’s broadened Morehead-Cain’s reach across campus, and formed relationships that hadn’t been there before. And so I really like the chance to hear about that. We discussed the Fall Banquet last night. It was the first time that new scholars met old scholars, and it’s always a great chance to be together as a community. Could you talk about the ways in which this impact will influence existing and future scholar classes within the Program? How they will form together. And what that might look like?*

(Chris)

*It’s a great question. We opened the Sophomore Selection process with two imperatives. One imperative was that the scholars had to meet the bar of every scholar that had ever come through this Program. They had to be at a similar level to yourself in the criteria that we have used to assess scholars for the past 75 years. But we also recognize that they had to have an experience here on campus that was similar to yours as well. They had to be fully integrated as scholars in every way, shape, and form. Last night, one of the things that I was really excited about was when we welcomed our new first-year scholars, our new sophomores. We actually introduced them alphabetically, regardless of what year of entry, because they are all scholars equally. They will have an onboarding experience in which the whole sophomore class, new and old, will get together in January for a day before school starts. And they’ll have the opportunity to participate in all of the experiences that make Morehead-Cain unique, from a finalist weekend in which they stayed at the Carolina Inn, just as so many of our scholars have in history, to an Outdoor Leadership experience that they will do with NOLS this year in spring break. They will have all of those experiences that make you a scholar and that create the cultural fabric that allow them to have meaningful conversations with every scholar who has come before them and every scholar who comes after them, whether they enter as a first year or enter as a sophomore.*

(Benny)

*So, anytime there’s a new initiative, people tend to have questions, and I know that you’ve helped answer some of mine. What questions have you been approached with from the Morehead-Cain community about this new initiative, and how have you helped to address those?*

(Chris)

*I think that’s a great question, Benny, and I think it’s important to note that the initiative will continue to evolve. We will learn from the experience of this year and the experience of inviting sophomores to shape both new insights about how we might better attract first-year students. At some level, I am amazed that so many of the scholars who were nominated never applied to Morehead-Cain, even though they were eligible. So that says something about how we might change our marketing in future years, but also how we will continue to evolve the sophomore process.*

*I think there are a couple of questions that people have asked me pretty consistently. One of those questions is how much of the value of Morehead-Cain is about attracting talent to campus rather than accelerating the talent that is on campus? And I think that it’s very true that Morehead-Cain played a very important, attractive role for you and your classmates at UNC. I do not believe we should be reducing the number of first-year scholars that we are enrolling out of high school. In fact, I hope there might be opportunities to expand those numbers, as we see in our high school process that there are large numbers of students with extraordinary potential. But I also believe that there are students who we can meaningfully transform in their journey, who can actually add depth to our scholar community, reach into spaces and departments that our scholars are perhaps less likely to be in, and who will shape the future of UNC in a way that’s been consistent with our mission for a very long time. And I believe that when we attract those scholars into our community, we will prepare them for a lifetime of leadership, just as we prepare you for a lifetime of leadership. So that’s one piece. I don’t think we should reduce our commitment to enrolling high school students, but I think there’s a meaningful deepening that happens here.*

*I think the other big question relates to something I mentioned earlier, which is there’s a real important focus from our alumni community on ensuring that new scholars that enter our community have an equal experience to those scholars who are already in this community. They must wear the Morehead-Cain Scholar badge with honor, and they must know that they have all of the rights and privileges of the scholars who have come before them. And we’re hoping to address that through being very, very deliberate in our programming experience for these scholars when they join us.*

*And what I have been so inspired by is the way in which the new sophomores have been present in our spaces and engaging with our current scholars from the day in which they learned of their selection. They are exceptional additions to our community, and I can’t wait to see what you all accomplish together.*

(Benny)

*And what are success metrics for this initiative that you think at the end of year one, as you mentioned, there can be iterations in continuing to learn and grow. However, what are signs that you know this was a great addition to our Program?*

(Chris)

*First, I would like to see that our scholars feel integrated. I would like to see that members of the class of 2026 who came here after high school feel that their peers who joined as sophomores are their equals, and I would like to see that those who joined as sophomores feel fully integrated into the community. Second, I look forward to following the impact that our new sophomores have and looking at how that impact and how that engagement in our programming compares to our scholars who join us out of high school, and how they engage with alumni, and how that engagement with alumni compares to the scholars who joined us out of high school. I think it’s really important that we take an honest look at the performance of this cohort and understand what we can learn from it to improve the experience of all students in the Program. I also think that there are metrics of success related to the way in which we transform our high school selection process through learning from these sophomores. One of the things about Morehead-Cain is that we’ve never had a counterfactual group. We’ve never had a group of students who are having an extraordinary impact on Carolina that we didn’t identify in high school, and the opportunity to ask ourselves what did they look like as high school students, and what might we learn from what they looked like as high school students to change our selection instruments for high school students, or to change the way in which we communicate to schools about who we are looking for, such that we can get the best and most diverse and broadest pool of scholars possible who meet our extraordinarily high bar.*

(Benny)

*Interesting. I didn’t even recognize that looking at the selection process from a sort of hindsight view in that way could be a way to measure success. So, thank you for sharing more in depth about the initiative. And speaking from the scholar community, we’re looking forward to getting to know the new scholars even better.*

*If I can transition, in December, you shared the findings of the Boston Consulting Group’s alumni survey. Broadly speaking, what did we learn?*

(Chris)

*I continue to be astounded by the depth of engagement and gratitude that I see from Morehead-Cain alumni all over the world. And I don’t think that is surprising to you as a scholar who has the opportunity to engage with alumni. And it’s not particularly surprising to me, either. But it is striking to see what I would say are three A’s that exist across our alumni base. One is a deep affinity for the Program. The second is a deep appreciation for Morehead-Cain. But the third, importantly for me, is a real aspiration for this institution. We were established to try to do something great, and in our alumni survey, we saw a lot of alumni asking us how we will continue to raise the bar and continue to be great. And that, to me is very motivating, and I hope that some of the initiatives that we’re tackling help us do just that. I also think that we recognize when we look at a survey like this, that there is a profound value in intergenerational connections and an aspiration from alumni to invest in the scholar experience. And I don’t know that we’ve deliberately created the right types of opportunities for that, and I think if we do so, there are benefits for alumni and scholars alike.*

*As an example, I think many alumni would love to be involved in our selection process, and we benefit from the service of over 400 alumni in that process every year. But I don’t know that we’re clear in our communication to alumni about how they can engage in that process, what it looks like, and how their input helps us make the decisions that we make. And similarly, I don’t know that we’re clear and deliberate in our communication to alumni about how they might meaningfully invest in scholars during their time on campus and how they might really help move scholars forward. We want to create more opportunities for shared learning, alumni to alumni, and between alumni and current scholars. We want to recognize and celebrate the plurality of perspectives and experiences that exist across our alumni base. And we want to work together with the aspiration that Uncle Mott had in 1945 as leaders who are creating a lasting, positive impact.*

*And so I hope that some of the investments that we will make in our community in the years ahead as a result of the impacts from the survey will really help move that forward. One of those investments is an expansion of the team. I’m really excited to add Jesse Soloff to our team this year. He’s a member of the class of 2008. He is a tremendous community weaver and will be joining us as vice president of community this coming January.*

(Benny)

*That’s very exciting news, and I’m excited to meet him. One of the things that I have always been most impressed by is something you described, which is the affinity and the engagement from alumni. So, for those listening, what are actionable ways they can get involved in the community based on recommendations from the survey?*

(Chris)

*Well, I would be remiss not to mention that today, as we are recording, this is the Day of Giving. And one way in which alumni support the Program that is profoundly inspiring is through investing in future leaders. We’ve been able to expand the program as a result of annual giving from alumni in ways that are really exciting. But alumni have said to us that they would like to give and get involved in other ways.*

*And so, here are some ways in which you can get involved. First, I hope that we will create with this investment in our community function more vibrant subcommunities locally, across the state, across the country, and across the world, that can support the recruitment and onboarding of new scholars but that also can welcome young alumni when they settle in your city to help them get to know folks, learn where they might find things, feel that they’re part of a community that’s bigger than themselves. I also hope that you will be invited to participate in the selection process and that at different phases of that process, every alum can expect to be invited to participate in some way and can choose to do that. Finally, I hope that you will see new invitations to opportunities to engage directly with scholars themselves. We would like to create more opportunities for structured communication, and structured correspondence for mentorship between alumni and scholars about both career paths, but also, importantly, to foster reflection on how we’re making the most of college. The reality is that when a scholar like you, Benny, comes and sits down with one of our staff, they disproportionately sit with someone who’s built their career in education. Our alumni have built their careers in a wide range of fields, and I think when you sit down and leverage the collective wisdom of all of those different fields and experiences, you might be able to create an even more transformational experience of college for yourself.*

(Benny)

*Another way that students and alumni alike have come together to learn and grow is through Food for Thought, a breakfast and conversation series launched in Fall 2022, and even in Dialogue and Discourse, a year-long program launched just this past fall for a cohort of 25 junior and senior scholars. Both center on productive discourse. Can you share about the strategy of incorporating these two initiatives?*

(Chris)

*Sure, and thank you for asking about this. I think this is a really important question for us to be asking as we consider Morehead-Cain as a model of college as it should be. One of the concerns that I have as someone who’s reentered a college campus and reentered America in 2021, is whether young people on college campuses today are able to engage in productive dialogue, whether they are able to disagree without being disagreeable. And I think that you have grown up in a social media era that has prized and celebrated stark black and white perspectives on things when the world is foundationally complex, and many things exist in shades of gray that are only discovered through really meaningful discourse.*

*I also want to celebrate, in the realm of Food for Thought, the work of a group of four now juniors, Tucker Stillman, Nigel Parker, Kate Quadland, and Kendall Lee. The four of them, who were part of Team Cleveland Civic Collaboration, had the opportunity, through our alumnus, Frank Sullivan, to attend a City Club of Cleveland Friday Forum, a lunchtime conversation with a leader, in which phones were off, and people were to ask any question consistent with the norms and an expectation of positive intent. And they sought to come and bring the same back here to Chapel Hill. And we have had the most extraordinary roster of leaders from across this country who have been able to spend a breakfast with us, share a perspective on a critical issue of our time, and take and respond to really important questions. I know that this podcast, Catalyze, has featured several of those speakers over the course of the last few months, and I encourage alumni to listen to them for a sense of what Food for Thought sounds like, whether it’s a conversation with Skip Griffin, who as a child was a plaintiff in a Virginia school desegregation lawsuit, or a conversation with Cindy Parlow Cone, the legendary soccer player who’s the president of U.S. Soccer and who spoke about the striving for equal pay for women’s athletes. And I think conversations like this have been fantastic.*

*But the reality is that dialogue is both about making the space but also learning how to create the space. And we need to foster leaders who are able to create spaces in which others can disagree productively and who are able to withhold their own judgments as they consider different perspectives on an issue. And our engagement with Skip and his partner, Bill Isaacs, who are out of Boston with a firm called Dialogos, allowed us to create this Dialogue and Discourse experience for junior and senior scholars, and I’m hopeful that they’re having an excellent experience. They’re soon to reach the midpoint of it. I know it has been challenging, but I look forward to seeing what they learn when this comes to its conclusion. It’s monthly sessions with three weekend experiences that will come to their conclusion in March, and when that happens, it will be great to see what those scholars have learned, and how it might influence future programming here at Morehead-Cain, but also feedback meaningful ideas to the new school that’s being created for civic life and leadership, or programs like the Agora Fellows here at UNC. It’s important that we are in dialogue with the university and its important initiatives on this front.*

(Benny)

*I couldn’t agree more with the importance of being able to have those difficult conversations, and you mentioned civic collaboration. My Minneapolis group had some of the most profound conversations. We pushed each other, but we were able to learn from each other. And when I saw the Dialogue and Discourse Initiative, I wish I was able to participate in it because I know how important and wonderful those conversations can be and should be.*

(Chris)

*Well, we look forward to seeing you, Benny, at the Food for Thought series from January to March this year. It looks like it’s going to be amazing.*

(Benny)

*Awesome. Transitioning now to the spring of 2023, we launched the Impact Educators Initiative. What was the thinking behind this initiative, and what were some of the takeaways from its first iteration?*

(Chris)

*I spoke earlier in this conversation about how, eighteen months ago, we thought about some different strategic questions in front of the Program. One of them is that we know that nomination of prospective scholars is really important. But we also see that in public schools in North Carolina and across the United States, college counseling is eroding as a profession. There are initiatives like the Carolina Advising Corps, for example, that are designed to supplement schools with college counselors because those are no longer positions that many schools can afford. Those are often the people who are historically doing the nominations for or helping students find information about a program like Morehead-Cain. We also see that in these communities, there are teachers who are extraordinarily driven, who are fixtures of their community, creators of community in these schools, and who transform the lives of students every day. It struck us that it only makes sense to celebrate these teachers and their impact and build a roster of educators across this state and country who know about Morehead-Cain and can help bring our attention to extraordinary candidates for the Scholarship.*

*So this year, we asked every semifinalist for the Morehead-Cain Scholarship in the class of 2027 to tell us the name of a teacher who had shaped their life. Benny, 372 educators across the state, nation, and world were celebrated by our semifinalists. We sent every one of those educators who were in high schools across the world a certificate. We sent them a sticker, we sent them a letter of gratitude, and we copied that letter to their school principal and their school superintendent. And I was so thrilled to watch as teachers put those certificates up in their classrooms, change their email signatures to reflect that they were impact educators by Morehead-Cain, or the superintendents of school districts who would write back expressing the gratitude for the way in which we had celebrated someone who they could see the impact of every single day. We offered the opportunity in North Carolina for North Carolina public school educators to apply for Impact Educator grants. These are grants that were funded by the Morehead-Cain Scholarship Fund and giving by our scholars and alumni. And they offered teachers the opportunity to explore something professionally meaningful over the course of the summer that could impact the way in which they invested in young leaders in the future. We were able to fund 26 grants of between about $1000 and $2500 each that are just like our Lovelace Fund grants. And we watched teachers do amazing things, from attending the National Student Journalism Conference to studying the history of civil rights in the South and taking a pilgrimage from Selma to Montgomery and ultimately on to Memphis, Tennessee. And these are things that I know will impact the teaching that happens in those schools for a long period of time. I believe that they have added to those teachers’ joy in their very important profession. And I also hope that they help these teachers and all of our impact educators understand what Morehead-Cain is about, understand the types of experiences that our scholars have, and help direct extraordinary young leaders that they meet to Morehead-Cain and to the University of North Carolina in general.*

(Benny)

*There have been many new things we’ve discussed. In addition, we had our first Faculty Appreciation Luncheon. We’ve had the Alumni Forum, which we mentioned. We’ve relaunched regional events in 15 cities, a tremendous rate of alumni participation. And the 60 new scholars in the class of 2027. Looking ahead with all of this in mind, what do you see as important objectives for Morehead-Cain in 2024?*

(Chris)

*Benny, it was great to hear you say those things because I realize we’ve accomplished a lot over the past year, and we would only be able to do it with an extraordinary staff, as I think all of our scholars and alumni know. And just tremendous commitment from this intergenerational community of Morehead-Cains across the world. And before we talk about 2024, I just want to reflect on 2023 and say a giant thank you to everyone in this community for the way in which you have made new impact possible and will continue to make new impact possible.*

*I also want to note that 2024 is going to be a season of celebration of someone who will be spending her 40th year at Morehead-Cain prior to her retirement in January of 2025. And that is none other than the incomparable Megan Mazzocchi. And I think it’s really important that we find opportunities throughout this year to celebrate Megan and also to learn from her and hear her stories of the past 40 years of the Morehead Scholarship and the Morehead-Cain Foundation. She is a fountain of knowledge and wisdom. If you haven’t spent time with her as a scholar, I hope you will. If other scholars have not spent time with Megan, I hope they will. And I really look forward to learning from Megan. I’ll put a plug here: I hope that we’ll create a podcast series with Megan, sharing memories from the past 40 years. I think that would be amazing. And I look forward to making sure that Megan has a send off experience this year that celebrates the foundation that she helped lay from which we will build the future. What she has done at Morehead-Cain is extraordinary, and I’m so grateful for the chance to work with and learn from her every day.*

*With Megan’s retirement and our continued new initiatives, it’s important that we stay learning. It will also be important that we continue to build and organize a team. Morehead-Cain is growing, and I think we need to organize our team around these core competencies that we have. Identifying extraordinary talent, empowering that talent through a “college as it should be” experience, and connecting that community. And so, I look forward to adding some new folks to our team and to organizing the team in that way as we continue to drive new initiatives forward.*

*We have some important physical plant things that we need to do. As you know, one of the concerns that we have had is making sure that we are a model for this University and accessibility. In January, hopefully, by the time this podcast is released, there will be a new lift that will allow our scholars who require wheelchairs for mobility to seamlessly move through the building for different meetings and experiences and will show what is possible from an accessibility perspective at this University more broadly.*

*And a year ago when I did this podcast, I remember talking about how we can continue to deepen our nominator network and continue to invest in rural scholars. We have had a long history at Morehead-Cain of identifying talent across the breadth of the 100 counties in North Carolina. I think it’s important, as the gaps in experience between the state’s wealthiest high schools and least resourced high schools continue to grow, I think it’s really important that we double down on a nominator and recruitment network that will help the most promising young leaders in the rural areas of the state access our application pipeline. I think our team, Tim Cheney, Ann Smith, and Sophia Gutierrez, in our Selections team have done an amazing job of reaching out to and building relationships with rural schools. That’s something that needs to continue.*

*And finally, I look forward to working with everyone who’s listening to making the most of the Morehead-Cain Network. I’m excited to see what the community team now formed with the backbone of the survey that we completed last year to take the work of the Morehead-Cain community to the next level and create new opportunities for alumni to learn together and for alumni to influence scholars. One of those opportunities coming up this April will be a civil rights tour of the South that I look forward to watching a range of our alumni participate in together and learn from together and to integrating some of the things that they learn into our work as we continue to shape and build the future*.

(Benny)

*I hear the excitement, the optimism you have for the future, and I also hear you echo the Foundation’s three competencies, which are to identify, empower, and connect. And I’m excited to see how that happens throughout 2024. Chris, thank you so much.*

(Chris)

*Thank you, Benny.*

## Episode Transcription

*I’m in my senior year here at Carolina, 203 days away from that spring afternoon, at which point I’ll be considered a proud Tar Heel alumnus. But who’s counting, right? What a time, honestly, what a time the past few years have been to be a Tar Heel. From a semester and a half in person to years of unparalleled uncertainty, to what was one of my favorite Carolina memories, being in New Orleans this past April, where we literally ended a career on the court. It’s been an interesting couple of years to be a Tar Heel, through all the passion, pivots, friendships, mentorships, loud laughs, and heartfelt emotions.*

*I’ve found that it’s in my nature to always look at what’s next, plan for the future, think about tomorrow, and all that that entails. A few months ago, a close friend of mine asked me a question I had never been asked before. It forced me to reflect quite deeply. “What makes you sad?,” he asked. And so, as a generally positive person, I didn’t know how to respond. And so I thought.*

*I thought of being woken up early one morning in the summer of 2018. “It’s time,” my dad told me. I got up still half asleep, made sure I wasn’t missing anything that I needed to pack or take with me on such short notice. After days and weeks of limbo, the question was whether my father, with his busy work schedule, and I, who at the time was completing a summer job, would take the flight over to India and meet up with my mother and younger brother, who were already there that morning. The decision was made urgently, and so we quickly left our home for the airport. After a long flight, as we were landing in New Delhi, I remember, as the plane touched down on the tarmac, as I was jolted awake, my father shared with me a text he had just received. He shared with me in Hindi.: “Kartik, tumhaare daada ab nahin rahe, your grandfather is no more.” Sweat, tears, ash, smoke, and fire is what I remember from a few weeks after that. I remember feeling hot and overwhelmed, being surrounded by flame and by ash. I remember performing my grandfather’s sacred last rites and cremation.*

*At this point, I turned back to my friend, who had been patiently waiting, and I answered her question what makes me sad? It makes me sad that over the past year or two I realized I was starting to forget the way my grandfather’s voice sounded, that I was beginning to forget the way his stories would mesmerize, the way his jokes would draw belly laughs. Yes, from him, too. I was beginning to forget the way that when he spoke, people listened. Ever since I was young, as my family would take trips to India to visit our extended family, to reconnect with our roots, I would reflect how easy it was to take for granted this ability to reconnect, the ability to live through shared experience, the ability to cherish the importance and value of honoring who I am and where I come from. I also took for granted that big old box of Indian sweets. My grandfather’s life, his passions and experience, challenged me to always appreciate and to love in a world that always seems to seek more to lift each other up, not push each other down. It made me think of all the moments in which I had been thinking and prioritizing a tomorrow instead of a today.*

*It also made me think beyond the convention of what we think of when we think of the word resilience. Challenging how I face and respond to disruption in a world that seems full of it. Because in a world that prioritizes haste and hustle looking forward at what’s big, what’s bold, and what’s next. How do we appreciate genuinely, how do we appreciate what we have today? How do we appreciate where we are right now and all that we’ve been through to get here? How do we cope with and respond to disruption in our lives? My grandfather would tell us, “You have to beat your own drum. You have to beat your own drum because you can’t expect anyone else to do that for you.”*

*I share with you all the question I was asked, “What makes you sad?,” not to make you ask the question of yourselves, but rather to think of those things, of those people, of those places and of those memories that keep you going, that make it worth it. Among many for me were those that included the time I shared with my grandfather. Because I realized in order for me to truly be able to stand strong, beat my own drum, and focus on what matters, I’ve realized I have to honor where I come from as well as those that sacrificed for me to be here. I have to realize disruption and change might be the only constants in my life. And I have to seek joy in what it is that keeps me moving, asking myself, “What is it that fills up my cup?”*

*Let’s not forget that it’s a true privilege for us to be here together again because not everyone can be. So let’s slow down. Let’s bring meaning to who we are and what we strive to be. Let’s be grateful for all that we have today, and above all else, even when it’s hard, even when it’s difficult, even when we think we cannot, let’s choose to live in the moment. Let’s choose to prosper, to thrive, to make the most of disruption faced, to think every step of the way what we’re thankful for now in the present, in a world that urges us to move swiftly, with haste and with hustle.*

*Folks, I’ve learned to appreciate the joy of the moment. And today is one of those moments. I’m proud to be here with each and every one of you. I’m proud to be here because you and I, we are together again. And as the adage goes: together, we are stronger.*

*Thank you.*

Today’s guest is Peter Hans, president of the University of North Carolina system and a Food for Thought speaker at Morehead-Cain.

On this episode, President Hans shares about how growing up in rural North Carolina has informed his work, his experiences as president of the North Carolina Community College System, and his perspective on the future of affordable public education in the state.

Hans received his bachelor’s in political science from UNC–Chapel Hill and a master’s of liberal arts in extension studies from Harvard.

The president served as the first Food for Thought speaker of the spring semester. He spoke with Allyson Horst ’27 of the Scholar Media Team after his talk with scholars at the Foundation on January 19.

Modeled after the City Club of Cleveland, Food for Thought provides a central meeting place for members of diverse beliefs and opinions to participate in free and open discussions. The breakfast and conversation series is an initiative of Team Cleveland members from the 2022 Morehead-Cain Civic Collaboration program.

## Episode transcription

(Allyson)

*President Hans, thank you for joining us today.*

(Peter)

*Thank you for having me.*

(Allyson)

*I enjoyed listening to your presentation this morning about polarization within higher education. What else do you hope scholars got out of your talk today?*

(Peter)

*Well, I was impressed, given the early time, that everybody stayed awake, was actively engaged, and had great questions for me. I think we covered a lot of ground. I was so impressed, as I always am, with Morehead scholars, their passion, their earnestness, their curiosity, and their potential. As I said to the group, I think the Morehead-Cain Program instills this obligation in public service in looking after Carolina and elevates their time in college to a whole different level. And so it’s just great to spend time with all these wonderful young people.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah. And you were talking to us today. You said you are from a very small North Carolina town, and how does being a North Carolina native help you to gain perspective about students and the overall UNC system?*

(Peter)

*Yeah. And let me define small town for you. I normally say I’m from Hendersonville because people sometimes have an idea where that is, near Asheville. But I’m really from a crossroads called Horseshoe, which, we’re now up to two blinking lights. It’s a few hundred people in the general community. And when I first came to Chapel Hill, it was a little bit of a culture shock because you’re here with 30,000 students. I’d never been away to camp. I didn’t know what was going on. And it turned out to be a wonderful, wonderful experience. But at first, I was sort of overwhelmed.*

*But having a sense of North Carolina, having lived in both on the coast and in the mountains, having spent nearly my whole life here, other than five years in Washington and grad school up north, that I’ve got a deep sense of this place. I love every nook and cranny of North Carolina. I love to play the game with people, stump me about where you’re from and where your family’s from and this sort of thing. I don’t always get it right, but most times I do. Because the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill certainly exists, because it is a global public research university, exists for a much wider audience, but the majority of the benefits and, of course, the funding come from the people of North Carolina. And I think that’s very special. North Carolina is extremely fortunate to have this place in our state.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah. And you’re a first-generation college student. And so coming to UNC-Chapel Hill for your undergrad, what were some obstacles that you faced, even though you did find comfort being a North Carolina native?*

(Peter)

*Well, the first obstacle was failing math class first semester. That was never my strongest subject, to begin with, and yet a requirement. And I didn’t come from the strongest background, math background in my high school, although that wasn’t to blame. My mind doesn’t always connect with these conceptual things in trigonometry, calculus, et cetera. So that was a challenge for me. I think my GPA that first semester was a two-five or something like this, and I was a little bit worried about would I find my people, would I find friends, would I find interests, when I was struggling just with the classes, and the absorption into this much larger community. But it didn’t really take long, by second semester and certainly by second year, to make lots of friends and to find professors who took an interest in me and studying things that I understood better than math, and I began to just love the place. And it was a wonderful journey, just four amazing years, and now actually living on campus in the president’s residence. It’s just very special to be back.*

(Allyson)

*And you’ve been in higher education for most all of your career, correct?*

(Peter)

*Six years on the State Board of Community Colleges, and then, of course, I became president of the community colleges. Twelve years on the Board of Governors and now almost four years as president of the University System. So some of those were volunteer roles, others, of course, primary responsibility for the community colleges and the universities. I didn’t set out to become president of the University when I was a young person. That didn’t cross my mind that that was somehow a career path or job option. I don’t know how it all transpired, but I hope it’s for the greater good. It’s certainly my joy and privilege to serve.*

(Allyson)

*So there was not a point of inspiration where you’re like, I’m going to enter higher education, or was there just like a light bulb moment that you’re just like, I’m going to do this?*

(Peter)

*Well, I took a great interest during my time at Carolina as an undergrad in both North Carolina and the University, and that’s clearly where it emanated. So, I knew I was going to be involved with public policy in some sense, but it was some years before higher education evolved as the natural path, and I’m so glad it did. I feel as though we can help more people in higher education than just about any other sector.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah. And in your tenure as president of the North Carolina Community College System, you accomplished significant advancements in enrollment rates, public funding, and cross sector collaboration. So, what lessons did you learn from that career that you can apply to your position today?*

(Peter)

*So, in the case of the community colleges, it was telling their story better. It’s often frustrated me that there is a stigma around community colleges when community colleges ought to be celebrated. They’re amazing places for all sorts of people, whether they’re looking to transfer to a four-year institution, whether they’re trying to learn a trade or a skill, or they’re looking for a second chance to help themselves, provide for themselves, even provide basic skills, including literacy. So community colleges are asked to do a whole lot of things, and their story gets confused or somehow looked down on, and that drives me crazy. So we were able to tell the story of community colleges, I think, more effectively, and thus attract more people to take advantage of those programs that they offer.*

(Allyson)

*And on that same note, you have a lot of initiatives regarding adult learners. I’m assuming that applies specifically to community colleges. And so how does your initiatives differ from that of different states? I’m from Florida. I’ve never heard of these initiatives before so I thought that was quite interesting. So if you want to speak upon that?*

(Peter)

*Yes, absolutely. So, particularly as it relates to the University, we have had such a steady stream of 18 to 24-year-olds coming to the UNC System. And this is a result of North Carolina’s population growing and the affordability and accessibility of the UNC System. Well, the demographics tell us that the traditional college-age-going demographic, again, 18 to 24-year-olds, is plateauing and is going to turn down. So that’s not my theory. That’s the birth rate. That’s a fact. We can see this coming at the same time, because we had so many young people coming through the system, we really neglected adult learners in North Carolina who then turned to out-of-state for profit providers, in terms of achieving a four year degree. And they offer a much higher cost, lower quality alternative to the UNC System. But you’re an adult student, you’re juggling life, family, work, you know, all these things. You’re not a typical college student who’s coming to have a residential experience at Chapel Hill. So we’ve got to reach that group in a different way, in a more flexible way, in a more adult-friendly way, because they are not necessarily able to come to a college campus. So it’s got to be high-quality, personalized online learning experiences. But most people don’t have all the answers about what they want to do with their life at a young age. They need those opportunities, and the UNC System needs to provide those opportunities to adults throughout their lives.*

(Allyson)

*Yeah. And on that same note of accessibility, UNC at Chapel Hill has recently adopted an initiative where if you come from a family of a family making less than $80,000 per year, you will pay $0 in tuition. I believe that was adopted, what, in October. Why was that number, $80,000, just like that number, why was that chosen? That’s what I was really interested in.*

(Peter)

*Well, I believe the intent is to raise it as far as is feasible, given the resources, because you’re cobbling together federal support, state support, and private support. So I wholeheartedly endorse that because it’s critical that public higher education be accessible and affordable and that cost not be a barrier. We know nationwide that confidence in higher education is actually declining because of the national narrative about the cost of higher education. And I don’t want that to be the case here in North Carolina. We’ve held tuition flat for in-state undergraduates eight years in a row. And I’m very proud of that because, again, I believe in accessibility, I believe in affordability, I believe in equality. And those have got to be the hallmarks of the UNC System.*

(Allyson)

*And then speaking of flat-rate tuition, so how do you foresee that in the future being sustainable, especially with the current economic crisis that is today?*

(Peter)

*Yeah, well, great question. I would like to see us get to a decade of no tuition increases. I think we will do so. But you’re correct. The inflationary pressures of providing that education are ever-present, and we’re trying to balance those two that are in some tension.*

(Allyson)

*Moving on to more life lessons, key takeaways. So, you’ve spoken previously of a nonlinear path to success in previous interviews. What has your own path to success taught you in life?*

(Peter)

*I think to be open to new things, new people, new ideas, new opportunities. There’s an old saying that God laughs at our plans, and I have found that to be true. We can make a great plan about all the things we’re going to do in life, and then life intervenes. So I think it’s good for people to develop particular expertise while they’re in college, but have a broad based education so they’re prepared for inevitable changes in the economy and technology and society and their own personal lives.*

(Allyson)

*And then today, you were talking to scholars about media consumption and lots of media going around and creating this polarization, so do you have any tips or things that you do to limit your media consumption today?*

(Peter)

*I have gone on a diet of news consumption because there is such a high volume through our phones, these addictive devices that we all carry around. And so much of it is misinformation, and it’s perplexing, that to limit the consumption of “news,” because a lot of it actually isn’t journalism, per se, it’s just content often designed to provoke conflict or provoke emotion, outrage. To limit that and to find meaning in so many other things outside of politics. Care about causes, but care about other people. Care about understanding who you are and what your place in the world is. Don’t make politics your identity.*

(Allyson)

*And my last question, I just have to, of course, ask you this since you are an alumnus of UNC, what is your favorite Carolina tradition or memory?*

(Peter)

*Oh, wow. I’ve got a lot. I’ve got a lot. As I said, it’s quite something to return to campus and live here. I am distraught about the closing of Ye Olde Waffle Shoppe on Franklin Street. You may not have gotten a chance to eat there. I ate there regularly, probably three, four times a week. And just so many good memories. Lots of things that happen on Franklin Street. I’m going to keep it PG for the purposes of this podcast, but Ye Olde Waffle Shoppe. I want to see Franklin Street revitalized so it’s a center of student life and activity. I think we’re making some progress in that sense, but it’s really the sense of community that I gained from my professors, from friends I made, from other classmates. It’s just a very special place, Chapel Hill.*

(Allyson)

*I’ve heard a lot of complaints about the Waffle House.*

(Peter)

*Have you?*

(Allyson)

*I have. There’s a big debate, actually, right now. I don’t know if you can include that in your presidency, but I think that should be a massive initiative, honestly.*

(Peter)

*Going to figure out a way to harness this energy so that we can reopen Ye Olde Waffle Shoppe.*

(Allyson)

*Some sort of private collaboration.*

(Peter)

*We need a greasy spoon right there to provide high-cholesterol breakfast and lunch.*

(Allyson)

*Of course. It’ll be so supportive for the community, truly. Thank you so much, President Hans, for joining us today. I really appreciate it.*

(Peter)

*Likewise.*

(Allyson)

*Thank you.*

# The Catalyze podcast: Josh Lee ’04 releases Lucha: A Wrestling Tale
[Back to Blog](index-2.html "Back to Blog")

A viewing of Lucha: A Wrestling Tale will take place during Discovery Weekend this March for Morehead-Cain recipients.

Most Morehead-Cain Alumni know Josh Lee ’04 as the co-founder of [Green Top Farms](https://www.moreheadcain.org/2023/07/from-friendship-to-a-force-for-food-justice-how-josh-lee-04-and-tommy-thekkekandam-04-of-green-top-farms-are-tackling-new-york-citys-nutrition-crisis/), a farm-to-table catering and food service company based in New York City. But after the work day, you’ll find the entrepreneur in the South Bronx coaching girls how to wrestle.

Josh is the founder of the Taft High School women’s wrestling team, one of the first of its kind in the city. A new film by Nike’s Waffle Iron Entertainment chronicles the team’s path to championship over the course of two years.

Centering on the experiences of four team members, [Lucha: A Wrestling Tale](https://www.luchamovie.com/) is a story of resilience, transformation, and victory. From family struggles to homelessness and immigration, the film gives an inside look at how the girls have found connection and success through wrestling. The docufilm was directed by Marco Ricci and produced in association with Noble Heart Films.

Lucha premiered at [DOC NYC](https://www.docnyc.net/), the largest film festival in the country, and received two awards. The film will be viewed during Discovery Weekend for Morehead-Cain recipients.

## Episode transcription

(Sarah)

*Josh, thank you so much for speaking with Catalyze.*

(Josh)

*Pleasure to be here.*

(Sarah)

*So I would say most alumni know you more so as a co-founder of Green Top Farms, a farm-to-table catering and food service company based in New York City. But after the workday, you’ve also been an entrepreneur in the South Bronx coaching girls how to wrestle. And so you just had a film that premiered last fall at DOC NYC, and so I just wanted to hear a little bit about the reactions from the film and then get to how this all came about.*

(Josh)

*Yeah. Thank you, Sarah. The response has just been humbling and super exciting. We’ve gotten a lot of positive feedback from folks we know, film critics, journalists, people who select films for film festivals. We’ve just gotten a ton of really positive feedback, and we’re super excited to take it to more film festivals and hopefully get it on a streamer somewhere.*

(Sarah)

*And Morehead-Cain recipients will have a lucky chance to view the film as well at Discovery Weekend coming up in March. So we’re grateful you’re willing to let this audience get a glimpse of what you’ve been up to as well.*

(Josh)

*I think it’s so cool to do a screening at the Varsity \[Theatre\]. We’re really, really excited.*

(Sarah)

*So this movie came about over a long period of time. I mean, this story goes back more than a decade to 2011, I believe. So take us back to that point in time where you are either pulled into or decide on your own volition to teach girls how to wrestle, which was not very common. And in fact, your team that you built has had a lot of milestones in firsts as well. So, what was the impetus for how you originally got started?*

(Josh)

*I didn’t actually set out to coach girls wrestling. I was trying to start a wrestling program in my school. It was my second year of teaching, and a few of the kids in my classes found out that I wrestled in college. And one in particular kept just bugging me, you know, “Lee, when you’re going to start a wrestling team?” So I inquired about it, and I was told that it would never happen in that building.*

(Sarah)

*Tell us about the school.*

(Josh)

*The school is not really a school. It’s a campus. And so in New York City, they used to have these mega high schools with thousands of kids, and at some point, they broke those up into much smaller schools, but they didn’t break the buildings up. So you have a weird scenario where you might have six or seven different schools all inside one building, operating independently in some ways. But in terms of sports teams, there are not six or seven different sports teams because they simply don’t have the facilities for that. So, the sports teams are based on the campus. And so the wrestling program was for the Taft campus, which used to be the Taft High School, but now is a campus with, I think, seven schools, including one or two middle schools, all inside the same building. So it’s a little crazy if you’re not accustomed to that type of school building.*

(Sarah)

*When there was discussion about starting a women’s wrestling team, were there already enough girls who were playing on the boys team that made it make sense? Or did you have this sense that there was enough interest already of those who would be interested in trying but understandably didn’t want to play on a boys team?*

(Josh)

*Well, we had no idea how many girls were going to come out for the girls team. The reason there was a girls league is because there was a Title IX lawsuit against New York City. And so that was the actual reason that they would not let us have a new team. The implication that it would never happen in that building was, I think, an unfair indictment of the kids. The implication was it’s not going to be worth my time, and the kids aren’t going to do it, the parents aren’t going to support, the administration is not going to support, and it’s going to be too hard to start a new program in a building where there’s so many different moving parts, which I just think is you’re kind of throwing the kids under the bus before they even get an opportunity to try it out. So we didn’t think that was fair. So, I actually coached at a different high school that year. And so the next year, they came back, and they said, “We’re going to add a new team. You’re going to get it. We’re also adding an all-girls league. And so you have to take a girls team, too.”*

*It wasn’t phrased in a, “Oh, you get a girls team!” It was like, “You have to take one of these, too,” which we were excited about; the more kids wrestling, the better. We had no idea how many kids were going to come out, how many girls were going to come out for the girls team. There was one girl who had come out on the boys team, Samantha, and she was just tough as nails. Turns out she had tried to apply to try out for the soccer team. And apparently, the soccer coach laughed in her face and said, “What are you talking about? You’re a girl.” And that just burned her up and made her very mad. And so she said, “All right, well, I saw these wrestling posters, and they didn’t say if it was boys or girls, it just said wrestling, so I decided to come out, and they asked me the first practice why I wanted to wrestle.” And she said, “I want to prove that girls can do anything boys can do.” And the whole team gave her an ovation. Like, everyone started clapping, all the boys.*

*And then, at the very end of the first season, we had this daily award that we would give out to whoever was the toughest kid in practice. We called it the Hustle Award, and the team voted on it, and they all voted for Sam. Not all of them, but she won the Hustle Award based on voting from her teammates, which was pretty cool. When the girls season started, obviously, it was very helpful having Sam, who had already come out. She did some demos, made the other girls feel comfortable. But we had, I want to say, 35 girls come out that first year, and we recruited the same as we did the boys. There was a lot of interest, and they took to the sport really well. Some of them really fell in love with it. And when you’re recruiting girls versus recruiting boys, girls tend to come in clusters. They tend to bring a friend or two. Boys will sometimes do that, but you get a lot more individual boys coming out for the sport, versus rarely do you get just an individual girl who’s not coming with her friends.*

(Sarah)

*And I should mention at this point that the movie is called Lucha, A Wrestling Tale. And lucha, of course, means struggle. So let’s go to when a documentary has its start. And I remember you talking about this a little bit, and it’s kind of a funny story, so share about how this program turns into the inspiration behind the documentary.*

(Josh)

*Yeah, we didn’t actually set out to make a documentary like this. When you get a new team in New York City, the way it works is you’re considered developmental for the first two years, which means, essentially, you have to prove yourself that you can recruit kids. They don’t want to spend money on programs that only have two or three kids or no kids. And so they told us, point blank, make sure you recruit a lot of kids, or they’ll yank the program in two years. So we were thinking of, we were going all out on the recruiting. We had posters everywhere. We had done a few highlight videos we would play on the TVs in hallways from the boys season. And my other coach at the time, Rob, mentioned he had worked on a documentary before, and we should do a documentary on the girls team as a recruiting tool. So we actually started doing that with a student film class in the building for the first year. They didn’t have great cameras or microphones or anything, but they had decent equipment, and they followed the girls around after practice and matches and did post competition interviews and came to award ceremonies and filmed them tutoring and doing study hall.*

*But that school got closed the very next year, and so it was sort of an orphan project, and we were thinking we might get a 15-minute hype video. That’s what we were thinking in terms of the documentary. And then over that summer, I was working as a task rabbit in New York, one of my many, many side hustles. Yeah, you can put almost anything on there, and somebody might sign up for it. I was helping a lady move some art supplies she was donating, and she had been storing them in this guy’s basement, Marco. And so when I was helping move these supplies, I was talking to Marco and asked him what he did for a living, and he said, “I’m a documentary filmmaker.” And I said, “Oh, that’s cool. I’m working on a documentary myself.” And he said, “What’s it about?” And I said, “It’s about an all women’s wrestling team in the Bronx.” And his eyes just got really big, and he said, “There’s women’s wrestling in the Bronx? I’m from the Bronx. That sounds like an awesome story.” And so he just kept following up and offering to volunteer shoot for us.*

*He said, “If you guys want to get started, I’m happy to start filming, and if you want to go a different direction, you can just have all the footage.” But ultimately, Marco came to the school, met the kids, fell in love with the story, said he just felt like there was magic there, and you obviously saw the film, so he was right. That first crew that we had on the girls team was really special. And some of those stories get, not all the stories, but some of those stories get told in the film. And he said, “Hey, I think there’s a real story here. I think there’s an actual movie here, something bigger than a 15-minute hype video.” And we said, “Well, that’s cool. You can do that, but we don’t have any money, and technically, we don’t have permission, because the school that greenlighted the project is closed.” And he said, “We’ll figure all that out.” And so he filmed, the majority of the film, as you’ve seen, is not in the school. It’s in their homes, on the streets in the Bronx, showing their personal lives. And he filmed them for the next two years and came back a third year for a few shots, never knowing if this thing would ever be approved or see the light of day.*

*And so he poured his entire heart into it, and so did all the folks working in the crew. Mauricio, Sherelle, the camera folks who are always around. Everyone was just putting so much love and heart into this project, not knowing if it was ever going to see the light of day. And we were just overjoyed when it finally did. And it was definitely a long road. We had to get forgiveness from the Department of Education. But eventually, when they saw the trailer and realized what it was about and realized it was going to be good for everybody, they approved it in 2020. It also helped that Nike had come on board at that point and was our co-producer, so that always helps.*

(Sarah)

*Yes, produced through Nike’s Waffle Iron films. And so, where did that connection come from? Was that through your contacts or through the directors?*

(Josh)

*That came through the Morehead-Cain Program, of course. Dave Bernath \[’89\], a buddy of mine that I met, I don’t know, three or four \[Morehead-Cain\] Forums ago, and he is in the entertainment industry, had some connections, and he got us a meeting with Cinetic Media, which is an agency that represents independent films. They loved the project and took it on, now they’re our agent, and started shopping it around. They sent it to everybody. They sent the trailer to every studio and production company and anybody you could think of who might want to do it. And everyone seemed to love it. And everyone had a “but” except for Waffle Iron. Waffle Iron said, “We love it. Let’s do it.”*

(Sarah)

*Very cool. I got to see it yesterday, and thank you for the permission to get that viewing. And you just fall in love with these girls and their struggles. They are trying to overcome the challenge of getting college scholarships and just applying to college at all, which we know is a really difficult process, and increasingly so. There’s someone who just moved to the U.S. and working on her studies and even some housing insecurity. So, can you share a little bit about the choices in determining these four women as those upon which to center the film?*

(Josh)

*Yeah. After the viewings, sometimes I will tell the audience that these girls’ stories are not remarkable at all. And you kind of get a gasp, like, what do you mean they’re not remarkable? And I’ll clarify that the young women that you see in the movie are incredibly remarkable. But in terms of their stories, the only thing remarkable about them is that we got it on film. So, to answer your question, we didn’t have to choose a story. Marco simply asked the kids and asked their parents, would you be willing to be part of this? And the ones who said yes are the ones he followed. Obviously, some of the stories are very moving, pulling your heartstrings. Shirley’s in particular. Nyasia’s, as well. Alba. I mean, all of them, really. But we had Shirley. Shirley wasn’t even the only Shirley on that team. And there’s Shirleys across the South Bronx, and there are Nyasias across the South Bronx and across America. And so, in that sense, these are everyday stories, especially for the kids who live in poverty. And the most remarkable thing is that we were able to get it on film. That is a testament to the perseverance of Marco and the ladies who really wanted their story told, in particular, Shirley. She was very adamant that her story get told, especially when she was a teenager. Now she’s an adult. When it came out, she didn’t want to see it. She said, “You know, it was a really hard time in my life. I’m not sure I want to relive it.” But she’s seen it, and she loved it. She’s seen it a couple of times.*

(Sarah)

*Yeah. Can you share where they are now? I know at the end they give a few updates about where they are when the filming ended versus at the beginning. But have you stayed in touch with them, and what can you share?*

(Josh)

*Yeah, we’ve stayed in touch. I’ll have brunch occasionally and invite them all over, but I try and stay in touch with my wrestlers as much as possible. Obviously, I can’t stay in touch with everybody. We’ve coached a few hundred kids, but Nyasia is a mom now. Mariam is a mom now. She’s about to be a mom again. Makes me feel so old. Although I’m already recruiting their kids, of course, and Alba’s working. She was pretty shy. She hasn’t really taken part in any of the film stuff since it’s come out. But she’s happy and working. And Shirley is still in school. She’s working full time. Marley’s working. Sam has a dog grooming business where I take my puppy to get washed and groomed. Shaq is working at the school as a dean. I think they’re all doing better than they would have been had they not wrestled. But I wouldn’t say we’ve necessarily moved the needle that much. I don’t want to paint too rosy of a picture that they joined a wrestling team, and now their lives are free of struggle. Not even close. There are still girls from the film who are living in shelters today. So, you know, there’s that reality.*

(Sarah)

*I appreciate about you, Josh, that you don’t like simplified stories, it seems like. And usually those are mostly for the listeners’ kind of gratification of you want to feel good, and this story has ended, they are doing well, and there’s no more complexity. So I do appreciate that that’s not your instinct to just provide that. But there also has been so many good outcomes, and I’m just wondering how you’ve thought about that. I mean, since ending filming, 100 women have wrestled on the team as one of the first women’s wrestling teams in the city. There’s been three city champions, two state champions, the programs for scholarship recipients, and I’m sure there’s been more updates since then because this was just from the film. So surely there has been some good, and we never know the ripple effects of our contributions. But anything you want to share about the good that you have seen.*

(Josh)

*Getting the two scholarships the year before COVID hit was one of the proudest moments I’ve ever had as a coach, second only to the moment when the first kid got upset with me for not bringing salads to practice. That was probably my proudest moment as a coach because I had gotten them hooked on healthy stuff. But seeing Ciara wrestle in college and seeing Hinda wrestle in college. You know Sarah placed fifth her freshman year, fifth in nationals, which is incredible. She’s out this year. She just had shoulder surgery, so she’s going to be back next year at a different school. Her first one was a two-year school, but I can’t even put into words how proud of them I am and what a great example they’re setting for future kids. And not just the girls.*

*The boys in the high school team look up to these young ladies a lot, especially since seeing the movie. The captain on the team this year, this kid, AP. He went to one of the screenings in New York, and he went up to one of the ladies after the film, and he said, “I want to be just like you.” No caveat. No “you wrestled good for a girl.” None of the qualifications that you might expect. He just said, “I want to be just like you. I love the way you wrestle. I think it’s awesome.” And so seeing that the program is still around and yet some of those numbers do need updating because now we have like 40 kids on our middle school team, over half of them are girls. So the numbers are continuing to climb.*

*What else? A couple of the ladies are working back in the schools, in the building, which is cool. Miriam and Shakaya are both working there and so obviously, they’re helping to recruit. We really had a ton of momentum before COVID. Obviously, the pandemic just took a wrecking ball to everybody’s plans. But I can say confidently, if we did not have COVID, we would have five or six girls in college right now on full scholarships, at least, maybe ten. Rebuilding the pipeline has been work, but it’s work we enjoy doing. And we’re very excited about the next few years. We actually have, the kids we have now are so lucky compared to the girls in the video. Some of them see what we’re doing now, and they’re like, “Why didn’t we get that?” And I’m like, “You were a trailblazer. It’s different. You were the first ones to do it.” These kids have something they didn’t have. They have role models to look up to who look like them, who’ve been through the program. They’re not the first ones, and they’re not just trusting these random men that they don’t know in a sport that they don’t know. So overall, it’s awesome. It’s the best work I’ve ever done. It’s the best thing I’ve ever been a part of, hands down, coaching in South Bronx. Very rarely am I happier. And I certainly don’t feel like I could spend my time any better.*

*I love that. And I remember an interview from a while back with Amber Koontz, who’s another Morehead-Cain Alum. And she knows said, “How you view yourself has an enormous impact in how you navigate the world.” And so just having the confidence of knowing you can win a championship, you can be on a wrestling team at all, and you don’t have to have a “good for a girl” mentality. So, what else would you like anyone to get out of the film? And I’m thinking of the recipients who will be watching. What do you want them to look out for? Or any overarching themes that you think would be beneficial for them?*

(Josh)

*Just watch it, I think. Don’t have any preconceived notions. People hear wrestling. They hear women’s wrestling and get a certain idea in their head. I venture to guess most people have never been to a women’s freestyle wrestling match ever. Most people have never been to a freestyle wrestling match of any kind, women or men, period. We don’t have the same size audience as some other sports, at least in the United States. But wrestling is the oldest sport in the world. And I won’t say women are the future of the sport because they’re already in the sport, but women are how the sport is going to grow in the future, and wrestling, in particular, has been fairly hostile to Title IX. A lot of the coaches, it maybe took the biggest brunt of the cuts after Title IX, the way it was implemented, but that was not the intention of Title IX at all. I don’t want to judge in hindsight, but I think what the wrestling world needs to do is double down on recruiting as many girls as possible because once we achieve gender parity in the sport, or even get close, I think the numbers are going to continue to grow. And it’s just the best sport in the world for teaching life lessons and learning discipline and learning how to do things that are going to help the rest of your life, like manage your weight and learning to eat healthy, because you cannot wrestle without learning those things. You can’t be good at all without learning how to manage your weight because that’s a key part of the sport. They don’t really touch that too much in the film, mainly because the editor said that we should not, but it is something we deal with.*

(Sarah)

*I was curious about the thought process of wanting to educate these girls more on nutrition, and that’s, of course, a major focus of your work with Green Top, is providing healthy food and trying to do something different than what the U.S. food system is dominated by. I was curious how much of your work at Green Top is informed by some of these experiences, or vice versa.*

(Josh)

*Oh, that was my experience teaching and seeing and really getting an up close view of food insecurity for the first time was the motivation behind starting Green Top, for sure. And just seeing what a school lunch looks like in America today. It’s embarrassing. You might have heard this before, but I just learned the acronym for the American Diet, the Standard American Diet, which is SAD, which I think is pretty appropriate, because it’s very sad. We’re just inundated with propaganda and marketing, and food has basically taken the place of cigarettes, and it didn’t even take the place of it. From 1980 to 2001, the cigarette companies owned the food companies, and so they just repurposed all of their dyes and flavorings that they can no longer put in cigarettes into kids’ snack food, because obviously you can’t waste product if you’re a cigarette company. So we have a long, long… that’s a whole different podcast, I think.*

*I don’t know if I’m answering your question. How does it inform what we do? It was the motivation behind starting Green Top in the first place, and we definitely do, if we’re trying out a new product, I’ll bring it to the kids and get their feedback for sure, because they’re going to be very honest. They’re going to tell me exactly what they think. And it’s difficult when you’re introducing healthy food in someone’s diet, and you’re competing with junk food, you’re competing with something that gives, like, instant dopamine hits. So it takes a lot more work to work that into someone’s diet. But once anybody gets hooked on healthy food, it’s equally hard to get them off of it because you just start to associate what you’re eating with feeling better. And once you can make that connection, the workload lightens a little bit, and it’s a little easier to get folks to eat healthy, but it’s really about creating the environment.*

*My next step in the South Bronx is to find a space that can be a permanent training center for the kids. Have a little pop up cafe there where we have healthy food for the kids every day. We feed the kids every day, as it is, it’s not always super healthy. We don’t have a refrigerator or any way to warm food up currently in the school. But once we have a training center, we’ll be able to do that and make the food a lot healthier. But if you feed them, they will come, for sure. If you feed the kids, they’ll show up. We have like 25 kids a day at middle school practice right now, and there’s only about 90 kids in the whole middle school.*

(Sarah)

*In college, too, if you have pizza at an event, maybe that’ll entice people to come, but I feel like it’s harder now.*

(Josh)

*I was a part of almost every club at Carolina when I was there because I just looked down. “Well, where’s the free pizza tonight? Cool. I’m part of that club now.”*

(Sarah)

*Okay, so maybe it’s still having a lasting influence there. My last question is you sometimes can seem very much a realist, and so I’m curious how you self-identify of either optimistic, idealist, pessimistic. Sometimes in our conversations you share the real problems that are happening and how it is very dire. But you also are dedicating your day job and your free time to tackling these issues. So how do you think about that?*

(Josh)

*That’s an interesting observation. I view myself as an optimist, for sure. I don’t think I could do some of the work I’m working on if I wasn’t an optimist. It’s interesting that I come across as a realist. I think that might just be the lack of a filter from growing up in Johnson county \[North Carolina\]. Sometimes it feels like if I had not just by chance gone to that one job fair and gotten a job at this school, if I’d have gotten a job at a different school or a wealthier school, I might have never known some of the problems that exist in the South Bronx. It was jarring to me, moving to New York City. Like growing up in North Carolina, I kind of knew what rich meant, kind of knew what poor meant. I knew what side of the tracks those were on in my hometown because we did have a train track going through our hometown, and depending on what side you live, nicer neighborhood or not, but I never really knew what super rich was or super poor. And they weren’t next door neighbors like they are in New York. It’s just so stark. You can go from Billionaires Row to project housing in a few blocks, and I’d never seen that. And it doesn’t make any sense to me. It’s certainly not built on a fair and equitable system. Anybody who thinks it is or says it is, they’re just blowing smoke. So I guess the realism part just comes from trying to stay grounded and do the work. It’s also the work that just makes me the happiest. I love coaching wrestling. I love the kids. I love teaching people about healthy food and getting folks hooked on healthy food. I love the sales part of that, like convincing folks that real food is better. I wish we didn’t have to. It would be nice if we were really like competing between who has the best turnips or tomatoes, if those were the arguments we were having about food versus should we have real tomatoes or this canned stuff with preservatives and everything else we don’t know is going into our body. So try to keep a healthy balance, you know, and do like Antonio \[McBroom ’08\] said in his SEVEN Talk, “Get a reset every year.” I just had a nice reset, so I’m feeling pretty good. If we’d had this podcast in December, I might have aired more on the realist side, especially since the weather was so bad. I was getting a little seasonal depression, but it’s kind of dreary today, but feeling I’m pretty good still.*

(Sarah)

*Yeah, I’m hearing like there’s of course the privilege of detachment and then the humility and perhaps call to action that comes from demolishing some of that ignorance and making a difference.*

(Josh)

*And one more thing I’ll add is working in the South Bronx, although it was shocking in a lot of ways in New York, was shocking when I first got here. A lot of times when I would hear the stories from the kids, it would remind me of my dad and his childhood stories and some of my cousins. In rural North Carolina, the poverty is just as bad as inner city somewhere. The races of the people are different, but the problems are the same, and the struggle is the same. So maybe I feel like sort of a kinship, maybe, with folks in the struggle just because of where I grew up. Our mom kept us in a very tight bubble to be where we were, but we weren’t ignorant of it. We saw what was going on with certain folks in our family who were not doing as well. And I had an aunt who ODed on meth, and cousins who are in and out of jail and don’t have custody of their kids and all sorts of issues, and a lot of the same issues you’ll see just in neighborhoods that have been ignored, neglected across America. And they don’t typically get documentaries made about them.*

*So this is a super cool thing that we were able to somehow get done, and I’m very humbled to be a part of it. And I hope everybody watches it and feels moved to support whoever they can, however they can. Certainly women’s sports, women’s wrestling, but also just anybody who’s struggling. That’s what the movie is really about, is the struggle. La Lucha.*

(Sarah)

*Yes. Josh, it is always interesting to talk with you. Everyone should go watch the film, and we’ll see you the screening at Discovery Weekend.*

(Josh)

*Awesome. I’m so excited. Thanks so much, Sarah.*
